input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your fingers move like whispers. The coin purse is in your hand in a flash, and the merchant is none the wiser. You slip back into the crowd."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: As your fingers touch the purse, the merchant shifts his weight. His hand clamps down on your wrist like a vice. 'Thief!' he bellows."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: The bartender leans in conspiratorially. 'I heard a treasure hunter took a map leading to it into the Shadowfen Crypts. Never saw him again.'
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The bartender scoffs, 'Fairy tales. Daggers don't have names. Now, are you going to order something or just stand there?'"
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your experienced eyes spot a thin tripwire near the bottom of the door, connected to a small dart mechanism on the wall."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The door seems old and heavy, but you don't notice anything out of the ordinary about it."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You get a running start and leap gracefully, landing softly on the other side with room to spare."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You misjudge the distance. Your feet slip on the edge, and you tumble into the darkness below."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wind howls like a hungry wolf, and the snow is so thick you can barely see your hand in front of your face. It is dangerously cold."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find purchase for your hands and feet in the ice, pulling your powerful frame up the cliff face with grim determination."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ice is too slick. Your grip fails, and you slide back down to the bottom, the cold biting at your skin."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your bestial roar echoes in the pass, startling the owl. It changes its course and flies off into the blizzard."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The owl seems only angered further by your shout. It descends upon you, talons extended."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The traveler looks up with grateful eyes, accepting the cloak and wrapping it tightly around their shoulders. 'Thank you,' they rasp."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You focus your hearing, filtering out the wind. The sound is rhythmic... like claws scraping on stone. It's close."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wind outside is too loud, and the scratching is too faint. You can't pinpoint its location or cause."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: Sunlight streams through a crack in the ceiling, illuminating floating dust motes. The silence is profound, broken only by your own breathing. The air smells of paper and decay."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the symbols as a variant of the Abyssal Cipher. After a moment of concentration, you trace the correct pattern, and the lock clicks open."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The runes are unlike anything you've ever seen. Your attempts to manipulate the magical energies of the lock result in a harmless but bright flash of pink light. The lock remains sealed.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The spirit lowers its hand, its expression softening from anger to sorrow. It nods slowly, gesturing for you to continue your work, but to be respectful."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The spirit is beyond reason. Your words do nothing to soothe it. It lets out another shriek and flies towards you, intent on driving you out."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your fingers trace the outline of the stones. You press one, and a section of the bookshelf grinds open, revealing a hidden chamber."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You spend several minutes examining the wall, but it seems to be just solid stone. Perhaps it was just a trick of the light."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You focus your mind, and the complex magical formula settles into your memory. You have successfully learned a new spell."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The magic is too powerful or too complex. As you try to grasp it, the words seem to slip from your mind like water. The spell is not learned."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your music is infectious! The crowd claps and cheers, and a shower of coins lands on the stage at your feet."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You hit a sour note on your lute, and the song falls flat. The crowd seems unimpressed, and a few people even begin to boo."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You spin a tale about performing for a noble's sick child. The guard softens. 'Alright, just... don't let me see you here again without a permit.'"
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guard is unmoved by your charm. 'I've heard it all before. Pay the 10 gold fine, or you'll spend the night in the cells.'"
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The Duke puffs out his chest, beaming with pride. 'Ah, an eye for quality! You are a man of taste. What was it you needed again?'"
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The Duke sneers. 'Do not try your cheap flattery on me, peasant. State your business and be gone.'"
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You overhear a pair of merchants talking about a recent caravan ambush on the North Road. They mention the 'Red Fang' goblins.
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tavern is too loud, filled with drunken singing and laughter. You can't make out any specific conversations."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The village is unnaturally quiet. The buildings are dilapidated, and the few villagers you see hurry along the streets, avoiding your gaze. A sickly grey fog clings to the ground."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You channel the power of your deity. A warm, golden light envelops the child, and the sickly pallor fades from their skin. Their breathing evens out."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You channel your energy, but the blight is too strong or of a nature unknown to you. Your magic has no effect on the illness."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the symbol immediately. It is the mark of a powerful shadow demon, one known for corrupting the land itself."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The symbol is crude and alien to you. While clearly unholy, you do not recognize the specific entity or cult it represents."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Seeing the conviction in your eyes and the holy symbol you bear, the villager relents. 'It came from the old manor on the hill,' he whispers."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The villager shakes his head, fear overriding any faith he might have. 'No! It will hear you! Leave us be!'"
input: [CHECK]: Divine Sense[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You close your eyes and focus your divine senses. The evil is overwhelming, but its source is clear: it's coming from below, in the crypts beneath the manor."
input: [CHECK]: Divine Sense[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The entire manor is so saturated with evil energy that you cannot pinpoint a specific source. It is everywhere.
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You press yourself into an alcove, and the guard walks past, his heavy footsteps echoing in the hall. He didn't see you."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You knock over a suit of armor with a loud CLANG. The guard spins around, drawing his sword. 'Intruder!'"
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With practiced ease, you manipulate the tumblers. You feel the final pin click into place, and the heavy door swings open."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The lock is fiendishly complex. You work at it for a minute before one of your picks snaps off inside the mechanism, jamming it completely."
input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You control your rage, recognizing his words as a foolish attempt to make you reckless. You stand ready, calm and focused."
input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: His words find their mark, stoking the fires of your rage. You let out a yell and charge forward recklessly."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You've seen tracks like this before in the high peaks. It's a Winter Wolf, a creature known for its cunning and ferocity."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tracks are large and canine, but you don't recognize the specific creature. It's big, and that's all you can tell."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You plant your feet, grit your teeth, and push with all your might. With a mighty groan, the boulder rolls aside, revealing the cave entrance."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Despite your incredible strength, the boulder is simply too large. It doesn't budge an inch."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You recall reading about Shambling Mounds in this region. They are dangerous plant creatures that can be hard to spot in this environment.
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Your knowledge is primarily of magical beasts and constructs; you know very little about the natural creatures of a swamp.
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the glyph as a simple ward of alarm. Stepping on it will create a loud noise, but it is not physically harmful."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The magic is unfamiliar to you. You can tell it's a trap of some kind, but you don't know what it will do if triggered."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: After a moment of thought, the answer becomes clear. You speak the correct answer, and the statue rumbles with satisfaction."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The riddle is too clever. You propose an answer, but the statue remains silent and motionless. It is the wrong answer."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a sure-footedness that belies the danger, you navigate the swaying bridge and make it to the other side without issue."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: A rope snaps under your weight! You lose your footing and are now dangling precariously from the side of the bridge.
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your feigned outrage is completely convincing. A large crowd gathers to watch the spectacle, giving your friend the perfect cover to slip away unnoticed."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your acting is unconvincing. The vendor just looks confused, and you only manage to draw the attention of a nearby city guard."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You give a vague but authoritative-sounding answer. The other person seems satisfied and walks away, none the wiser."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You hesitate for a moment too long, and your answer is unconvincing. The person's eyes narrow with suspicion. 'You're not a guard!'"
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your practiced hands clean and dress the wound expertly. The bleeding stops, and the soldier gives you a weak but grateful smile."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You do your best, but the wound is severe and your supplies are low. The bandage you apply is clumsy and doesn't fully stop the bleeding."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: The animal seems to sense your peaceful intentions. It stops growling and cautiously allows you to approach.
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The corruption has driven the animal mad with fear and pain. It shrieks and lunges at you, ignoring your attempts to calm it."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice that one path has healthy plants growing alongside it, while the other is surrounded by decay. The safer path is clear."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The entire forest is so thoroughly corrupted that you cannot tell if one path is any safer than another. All directions look equally perilous.
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: The image comes to you clearly: a coiled serpent with a key in its mouth. That's the mark of the Shadow Scale guild.
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You remember hearing of the guild, but you can't for the life of you recall what their specific mark was."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your muscles bulge as you put your power into it. The champion's hand is slammed to the table with a loud thud. You are the new champion.
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The champion is surprisingly strong. Despite your best efforts, your hand is slowly and steadily forced down onto the table. You lose."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You feel the poison burn in your veins, but you grit your teeth and fight through it. The worst of the effects subside."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The poison overwhelms you. A wave of nausea and weakness washes over you, and your vision begins to blur."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: In a few deft movements, you pull on a cloak, affix a false beard, and change your posture. You are unrecognizable."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You fumble with the disguise, getting the beard on crooked and tripping on the hem of the cloak. You look ridiculous, not disguised."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You feel a calming presence and a gentle mental nudge, a feeling of certainty that you should head east, toward the rising sun."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Your prayers feel like they are being absorbed by the oppressive darkness of this land. You receive no answer and feel only silence.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air is thick with the buzz of insects and the calls of strange birds. Massive, vine-choked trees blot out the sun, casting the jungle floor in a perpetual green twilight."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your trained eyes spot a large, fallen tree just a bit upstream that forms a sturdy, natural bridge to the other side."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The river is wide and fast. You can't see any obvious safe crossing points nearby; you'll have to risk swimming or find another route.
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the tracks. It's a Horned Gorilladon, a large and aggressive herbivore. The tracks are fresh, no more than an hour old."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tracks are from a large creature, but you don't recognize the species. You can't tell if it's a predator or prey."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You move like a shadow through the jungle, making no sound. You peek through a large fern and see your quarry grazing in a small clearing."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: A dry twig snaps under your boot with a loud crack. The rustling stops, and you hear the creature crashing away through the jungle, alerted to your presence."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The hallway is dark, lit only by moonlight filtering through grimy windows. The peeling wallpaper looks like sunburnt skin, and the silence is broken by the drip-drip-drip of water somewhere nearby."
input: [CHECK]: Pact Magic[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: A whisper enters your mind, not in a language, but as pure comprehension: 'A prisoner, forgotten by time, bound by regret. It fears the light.'"
input: [CHECK]: Pact Magic[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You reach out to your patron, but the whispers that return are a maddening cacophony of alien thoughts, giving you a splitting headache but no useful information."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The strange symbols swim in your vision and then resolve into meaning, a direct gift from your patron. The text describes a ritual of summoning."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Even with your patron's knowledge, the language is too ancient and obscure. You can only decipher a few words: '...portal...black sun...'"
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your eyes glow with an unsettling purple light. The cultist sees something indescribable in their depths, shrieks in terror, and flees the asylum."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You channel your patron's energy, but the cultist just laughs. 'A parlor trick! You are not worthy of this power!' He draws his own ritual dagger."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The hall is filled with music, laughter, and the clinking of goblets. Nobles in fine silks gossip at long tables, while servants carry platters of roasted meats and exotic fruits."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice the Baron's eyes frequently dart towards the guards at the exits, and his hand nervously taps the hilt of his sword. He is deeply anxious about something."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The Baron is a skilled courtier. His posture is relaxed and his smile seems genuine. You can't read anything unusual in his demeanor.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your words, spoken with conviction, silence the hall. The jester shrinks back, abashed. The squire looks at you with immense gratitude, and a few nobles nod in approval."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: A few nobles snicker at your outburst, amused by your 'lack of humor.' The king looks annoyed at the interruption, and the jester simply makes you the butt of his next joke."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You 'stumble' past the king's chair, jostling his arm just enough to send the goblet of wine splashing to the floor. The king is annoyed, but safe."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You move too slowly. The king takes a deep drink from the goblet just as you reach him. His eyes go wide, and he clutches his throat."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your eyes scan the surface. For a brief moment, you see a ripple that moves against the current. There's something large submerged in the water."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The water is dark and smelly, but you see nothing besides floating refuse. It seems safe enough to cross."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a powerful shout, you heave the massive stone. It flies through the air and lands several feet past your opponent's mark. The crowd roars!"
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You lose your footing on the throw. The stone slips from your grasp, landing short of your opponent's mark with a disappointing thud."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the ingredients and the stage of brewing. It's a Potion of Invisibility, but it's currently unstable. It needs one more ingredient to be completed."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You can tell the potion is magical, but the specific combination of reagents is unfamiliar. You have no idea what it does or if it's safe."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guard is so flattered and entertained by your song that he momentarily forgets his duty, stepping aside to applaud you. You slip past him."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guard is not amused. 'Very pretty, songbird. Now get out of here before I arrest you for loitering.'"
input: [CHECK]: Dexterity[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: As skeletal hands erupt from the ground, you maintain your balance and are able to avoid their grasp."
input: [CHECK]: Dexterity[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You stumble as the ground heaves. A skeletal hand bursts from the soil and grabs your ankle, holding you fast."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You make slow, non-threatening movements. The wolf seems to understand you mean no harm. It lies down, whimpering, and allows you to approach."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Despite your calm demeanor, the animal is too consumed by pain and fear. It lunges, snapping its jaws at you."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: As the imp speaks, you feel a subtle weave of magic in its words, an enchantment of suggestion. You recognize the attempt to cloud your judgment."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The imp chatters and gestures, and you are so caught up in its performance that you don't notice the faint magical aura of its lies."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: They threaten and cajole you, but your will is iron. You reveal nothing, staring back at them with silent defiance."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Under duress and exhaustion, your resolve finally cracks. You inadvertently let slip a key detail about the camp's location near the old mill."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You move with the grace of a cat, your feet sure on the narrow stone. You safely reach the window at the other end."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: A strong gust of wind throws you off balance. You slip from the ledge, your only hope the bustling street far, far below."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a primal scream, you pit your strength against the mechanism. The portcullis groans to a halt under your power, giving your allies just enough time to slide under."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The portcullis is too heavy. Despite your straining muscles, it continues its slow, inexorable descent, sealing the exit."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the banners and geography. This depicts the Battle of the Weeping Plains, where the last king of the Elven dynasty fell. You even spot a figure that matches the description of a legendary wizard."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tapestry is old and faded. While you can tell it depicts a large battle, you don't recognize the banners or any of the key figures involved."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The melody comes to you first, and then the words follow, a gentle and soothing tune from a forgotten age. You begin to hum it softly."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You know you've heard the song before, but the exact words and melody escape you. You can only recall a few disjointed fragments."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your calm, authoritative voice cuts through their anger. They pause, looking at your holy symbol, and a sense of shame comes over them. The argument subsides."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Their hunger and desperation make them deaf to your words. 'Your faith won't fill our bellies!' one of them shouts, and the argument escalates."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: After watching for an hour, you've memorized their routes. There's a five-minute window every half-hour when the camp's west entrance is completely unguarded."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The goblins are disorganized and chaotic. There are no discernible patterns to their patrols, making it impossible to predict a safe time to enter."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You choose your words carefully, painting yourself as a misunderstood scholar. The magistrate, lacking concrete evidence, grudgingly releases you with a warning."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Your strange manner of speaking and the dark aura you exude make your words of innocence sound hollow. The magistrate is unconvinced. 'To the cells!'
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You and your horse are one. It responds instantly, leaping gracefully over the obstacle without breaking its stride."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The horse shies away from the log at the last second, startled. It rears up, and you have to fight to stay in the saddle and bring it back under control."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: The air is filled with shouting and the crash of breaking furniture. The other patrons are either fleeing or forming a circle to watch the brawl.
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You move with disciplined speed. A series of precise strikes to his wrist and elbow forces him to drop the chair leg, his arm numb but unharmed."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You move in to strike, but the man swings wildly. You are forced to dodge, and he maintains his grip on the makeshift club."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You see an opening. A quick, precise jab to the brawler's shoulder leaves his arm temporarily paralyzed. His aggression turns to shocked confusion."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The brawler is moving too erratically. Your attempt to strike a pressure point misses, and he shoves you back into the crowd."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sky is choked with orange smoke, and the roar of the fire is deafening. Animals are fleeing in a panic, and the heat is intense even from a distance."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You slam your staff into the ground, and a wave of cool, damp energy flows from you. The underbrush in a direct line to the deer becomes soaked and green, creating a safe path."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You try to channel the forest's energy, but the fire's destructive power is too overwhelming. Your magic sputters, unable to affect the raging inferno."
input: [CHECK]: Druidic Magic[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You soar into the sky, your keen eagle eyes cutting through the smoke. You spot the origin point: an abandoned campfire that was not properly extinguished."
input: [CHECK]: Druidic Magic[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The smoke is too thick and the updrafts from the heat are too violent. You are unable to gain enough altitude to see anything useful.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You notice that the flagstones around the largest chest have slightly different coloration. They are likely pressure plates for a magical trap.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The room appears flawless. The magic is expertly woven into the room's very architecture, leaving no visible clues as to how the traps are triggered."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you are not a man of many words, you speak with a raw honesty that captivates the court. Your testimony is seen as highly credible."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are uncomfortable in this formal setting. You fumble your words and come across as gruff and uncooperative, which makes the magistrate doubt your testimony."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recall a passage from a dusty tome: obsidian golems are vulnerable to sonic attacks, as the vibrations can shatter their crystalline structure."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your knowledge is vast, but you can't recall anything specific about this type of construct. As far as you know, it has no particular weaknesses."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You read the riddle and smile. It's an old classic. You speak the answer, and the stone door grinds open."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The riddle is annoyingly clever, and the answer eludes you. The door remains firmly shut."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the symptoms—a faint grey shimmer on the skin and recurring nightmares. This is the work of a Dream Spore, a dangerous magical fungus."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The symptoms are unlike any you have ever studied. The plague is both magical and aggressive, but its specific nature is a mystery to you."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your sharp eyes spot a small patch of green on the horizon, far in the distance. It's a long shot, but it's the only sign of vegetation, and therefore water, for miles."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The heat haze warps the horizon. All you can see in any direction is an endless sea of sand. There are no signs of water.
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You scan the crowd and your eyes land on a man in fine clothes whose shadow seems to stretch and twist in unnatural ways. That has to be him.
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Everyone here is a master of deception, wearing social masks. You can't sense any specific dark energy among the general air of political intrigue."

input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your story is a bit too embellished, and the mayor sees right through it. He dismisses you as a common charlatan."

input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You speak with honor and conviction. The sincerity in your voice is palpable, and the magistrates agree to look more deeply into the matter, suspecting a setup."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your earnest plea is dismissed as the desperate words of a guilty man. The evidence against you is strong, and your honor alone is not enough to sway them."

input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You have never seen a plant like this before. Its vibrant glow could be a sign of potent magic, or a warning of deadly poison. You cannot be sure."

input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The noises are too jarring. Every time you begin to find focus, a loud crash or shout breaks your concentration. Meditation is impossible."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You place your palm on the dusty ground and feel for the tell-tale signs of life. You sense a small underground spring about a hundred yards to the north.

input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are a warrior, not a storyteller. Your tale is clumsy and grim, and it only serves to frighten the refugees further."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: This altar is not divine but psionic, a focal point for mental energy. It seems to amplify the thoughts of those who touch it."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The energy is utterly alien. It feels ancient and powerful, but its purpose and origin are a complete mystery to you."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You nock an arrow, draw, and release in one fluid motion. The arrow flies true, and the deer drops silently."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Just as you release the arrow, the deer is startled by a sound and bolts. Your arrow sinks harmlessly into a tree."

input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The noble's face is a perfect, unreadable mask. You have no clue which, if any, of the goblets is safe to drink."

input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You plant your feet and raise your shield. The boar crashes into you with incredible force, but you hold your ground, stopping it in its tracks."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The boar is more powerful than you anticipated. It slams into your shield and sends you flying backward into the mud.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: After some searching, you find the book tucked away on a high shelf, bound in what looks like human skin."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You search for hours, but the library's cataloging system is a mess. You can't find the specific book you're looking for."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the poison and know the correct herbs to counteract it. You quickly create and administer a poultice that neutralizes the toxin.
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The poison is alien to you. You try a few general antidotes, but none of them have any effect on the spreading toxin."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though skeptical at first, the guard cannot ignore the evidence you've presented. 'I... I'll report this to the captain immediately,' he stammers."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guard laughs in your face. 'The noble, a vampire? That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Now move along before I arrest you for slander.'"

input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The orcs are skilled trackers themselves and have covered their path well. You lose their trail in the rocky terrain.
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guards walk right past your hiding spot, their lanterns cutting through the darkness just feet from where you are, but they see nothing."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: A loose stone shifts under your foot, making a soft scraping sound. 'Did you hear that?' one of the guards says, and they turn to investigate your alley."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize this as a Sunpetal. It's rare and its petals have powerful healing properties when crushed and applied to a wound.
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You've never seen a plant like this before. Its glow could be a sign of great power, or a warning of a potent poison."

input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the pattern in the symbols. After a few moments of thought, you align the rings correctly, and the door clicks open."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The logic of the puzzle is completely alien. You try several combinations, but none of them work. The door remains sealed."

input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The forest is too dense and uniform. Every spot seems as vulnerable as the last. You'll have to sleep with one eye open.

input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You let the insults wash over you. You recognize them as a tactic to make you reckless, and you remain calm and focused."
input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: His words strike a nerve. A red rage clouds your vision, and you charge at him recklessly, leaving yourself wide open."

input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The markings are precise and symmetrical, clearly not the result of a random attack. They match the ritual sacrifice patterns described in your forbidden texts."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The markings are chaotic and brutal. It's impossible to tell if they have any ritual significance or if they are just the result of a savage attack.
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You filter out the background noise and focus on the conversation. You learn that the beast is a Manticore and that it lairs in the nearby cliffs.

input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The door is reinforced with iron. You slam into it with a painful crunch, but it doesn't budge. You are left with a sore shoulder."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a steady hand, you insert a small metal shim into the mechanism, preventing the plate from depressing. The trap is disabled."

input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your keen eyes spot a small, almost invisible seam in the wall next to the door. It's a hidden latch that releases the seal."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The door and the wall around it are seamless. There is no physical mechanism; the only way through is to break the magic.
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You place a hand on one of the stone trees and feel a faint, slow pulse. There is a spark of life deep within the petrified wood."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The trees are completely inert. They are nothing more than stone now, their life force long gone."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You expertly plant the rumor, and within the hour, you can hear people whispering about it at every table."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Your attempt is too obvious. The person you tell the rumor to realizes what you're doing and calls you out on it.
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You down mug after mug of ale, barely feeling the effects. Your opponent turns green and passes out under the table."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ale is stronger than you're used to. Your head spins, and you are the first to slump over the table in a drunken stupor."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You dive out of the way just as the massive stone crashes down where you were standing, sending dust and debris everywhere."

input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your prayers feel empty, and you receive no answer. You are left alone with your doubts and fears."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You create a well-camouflaged pit trap on a path you know the beast uses. It's perfectly placed.
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your trap is clumsy. The beast easily spots it and avoids it, now alerted to your presence in its territory."

input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your aim is slightly off. Your lance glances off your opponent's shield, and you barely manage to stay on your own horse."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You control your breathing and your steps are impossibly light. You cross the room without a single leaf crunching under your feet.
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Despite your best efforts, a single leaf crunches loudly under your foot, the sound echoing in the silent room."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You draw the poison from the water, and the river begins to run clear again. The nearby plants and animals are saved."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The pollution is too potent and unnatural. Your magic can't purify it, and the river remains a toxic sludge."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the cut and clarity of the stone. It's a valuable fire opal, worth a small fortune."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: It's a pretty rock, but you're not an expert. You have no idea if it's a priceless gem or a worthless piece of glass."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You match the bear's brute strength with your own, wrestling it to the ground and holding it pinned until it submits."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The bear is a whirlwind of claws and teeth. It easily throws you off and pins you to the ground.
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sequence comes to you from a book you read long ago. You press the runes in the correct order, and the portal hums to life."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You press the runes in a sequence you think is right, but nothing happens. You've either forgotten the sequence or it was never recorded in any book you've read."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your calm demeanor and clever suggestions help both sides see a path to a mutually beneficial agreement. You successfully avert a guild war.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Both guilds are too stubborn and hot-headed. They ignore your attempts at diplomacy, and the negotiation breaks down into shouted threats."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice that the person's eyes still have a faint spark of life in them. This is a powerful curse, but it is not permanent. It can be reversed with the right ritual."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The petrification is complete. The person is now nothing but a lifeless statue. There is no magic in this world that can bring them back.
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice a few scuff marks and a single, overturned pebble. It's not much, but it's enough to tell you which way your quarry went."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The creature left no tracks on the hard stone. The trail has gone completely cold.
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You engage the demon in a clever war of words, and it accidentally reveals its true name in a moment of arrogance."

input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your words are filled with courage and conviction. The guards are inspired, and they stand ready to defend the castle to the last man."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your speech is stiff and formal. It fails to stir the hearts of the common soldiers, who just look at you blankly."

input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your master is impossibly fast. He closes his hand long before you can reach the pebble. 'You are not yet ready,' he says calmly."

input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: 'The king?' the guard says with a suspicious look. 'He's visiting the summer palace. You're no messenger. State your real business.'
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: The goblins witness your incredible display of strength and decide you are not worth fighting. They flee in terror.
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You manage to crack the rock, but it's not a very impressive display. The goblins just laugh and ready their weapons."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the creature as a Displacer Beast, a magical feline that can bend light to appear as if it is several feet from its actual location."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: You've never seen or read about a creature like this before. You have no idea what it is or what it can do.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: The merchant is so taken with your charming personality and love of music that he agrees to sell you the lute for half price.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The merchant is a shrewd businessman who is immune to your charms. He refuses to budge on the price.

input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your loud, clear voice cuts through the noise of the panic. The crowd looks to you, and your calm demeanor helps them to get a grip on their fears."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The crowd is too consumed by fear to listen to you. Your words are lost in the chaos.
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You focus your mind and are able to dissociate from the pain. You are aware of it, but it does not affect you."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The pain is too intense. It shatters your concentration, and you are unable to block it out."

input: [CHECK]: Tinker's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find that a key gear is completely sheared in half. Without a replacement part, which would have to be custom-forged, the clockwork is beyond repair."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You present your holy symbol, and it flares with brilliant light. The zombies recoil, their necrotic forms unable to bear your divine power, and several of them are instantly destroyed."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You call upon your deity, but the sheer number of undead creates a tide of negative energy that smothers your divine power. The zombies are unaffected and continue their advance."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You notice a woman in the back whose simple clothes can't hide the priceless gemstone on her ring or the expert cut of her robes. She is the real power here.
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Everyone here is either dressed to the nines or intentionally dressing down. It's impossible to tell who is truly wealthy and who is just posturing.
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You plant your feet like boulders, and the river parts around you. You are unmoved by its power and cross to the other side."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The current is too strong. It sweeps your feet out from under you, and you are carried downstream, sputtering and struggling to stay afloat."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your eyes light up as you find a chapter detailing a powerful teleportation circle variant you've never seen before. A worthy prize.
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The archmage was powerful, but not particularly creative. The spellbook contains only standard incantations, all of which are already in your own collection."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your charming demeanor and harmless appearance work perfectly. The guards, bored with their post, wave you through without a second thought."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The captain of the guard is a grim, suspicious man. He sees your fine clothes and quick wit not as harmless, but as the signs of a spy. You are denied entry."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You quickly identify the most severe injury—an arterial bleed—and apply pressure, saving the soldier's life."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The soldier has too many grievous wounds. By the time you stop one bleed, another has become too severe. You are unable to save them."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Filtering out the chirping of insects, you hear it: a heavy, sloshing sound to your left. That's your target."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The swamp is a cacophony of nighttime noises. It's impossible to pick out one specific sound from the rest.
input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You center yourself, and the whispers fade into meaningless background noise. Your mind is your own."
input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The whispers are too insidious. They bypass your defenses and plant seeds of paranoia and doubt in your mind.
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The peasant speaks with the desperation of the wronged, while the merchant's eyes shift nervously when questioned. You are certain the peasant is being truthful."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Both are convincing. The peasant seems genuinely distressed, but the merchant has a signed and sealed deed. You cannot tell who is lying."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your movements are precise and controlled. You run along the wall as if it were a wide, paved road."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: A loose brick gives way under your foot. You stumble and are forced to jump down from the wall to avoid a nasty fall.
input: [CHECK]: Sylvan[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You speak to them in their own language of tinkling bells. They tell you a large, iron beast (a logging machine) has entered their woods."
input: [CHECK]: Sylvan[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your accent in their strange language is clumsy. They either don't understand you or take offense, and they buzz around you angrily before disappearing."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You notice a poorly reinforced servo in its left leg. A well-placed blow there should cripple it.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The construct is a masterpiece of design. Its armor plating is seamless, and there are no obvious weak points to exploit."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You call upon your oath, and a wave of pure, divine energy washes through the commoner, purging the disease from their body. They are miraculously cured."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The disease is too powerful, or your faith is not strong enough this day. Your healing energy provides a moment of comfort, but it cannot cure the affliction."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The lock is intricate, but you are a master of your craft. After a few tense moments, you hear a satisfying 'click' and the door swings open."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: This lock is beyond your skill. It was made by dwarves and has too many tumblers. You are unable to open it.
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your opponent is strong, but you are a force of nature. With a final, mighty push, you slam his hand down on the table, winning the contest."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You've met your match. The man's grip is like iron, and he slowly, inexorably forces your arm down onto the table. You are defeated."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the patterns of a substitution cipher. It takes some time, but you are able to decode the message."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The cipher is magically encrypted. Without the keyword, which you do not have, it's impossible to read."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your friendly and disarming nature puts the informant at ease. They let slip a crucial detail they weren't supposed to.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The informant is a professional. They are immune to your charm and refuse to say a word.
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your holy senses allow you to see through the illusion. The moving shadows are not shadows at all, but lesser demons hiding in the gloom."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The shadows are deeply magical and confusing. You can't tell which are real and which are manifestations of the tomb's curse.
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a deep snowdrift and are able to quickly dig out a small, insulated cave that will protect you from the worst of the storm."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The snow is too powdery and will not hold its shape. You are unable to build a stable shelter and are left exposed to the elements.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: A whisper of insight from your patron informs you that this is the egg of a Void Lurker. It is dangerous, but its shell is a potent arcane focus."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your patron is silent on this matter. You are left alone with the strange, throbbing object, unsure if it is a treasure or a trap."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your heartfelt words stir something within the peasants. They find their courage and take up makeshift weapons, ready to defend their homes."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are a noble knight, and your words about honor and glory mean little to these simple farmers. They are too afraid to fight."
input: [CHECK]: Dexterity[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your reflexes are legendary. Your hand snaps out and plucks the arrow from the air an instant before it would have struck you.
input: [CHECK]: Dexterity[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The arrow is too fast. You try to catch it, but it zips past your fingers, leaving a painful sting."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You speak to the bear in soft, soothing tones. It seems to understand you are trying to help, and it lies still while you work on the trap."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The bear is in too much pain and is terrified. It sees you as another threat and lashes out, making it impossible to get close to the trap."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You see the logic of the trap's design. By jamming a single gear, you can disrupt the flow of magic and render the trap inert."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The trap's design is baffling. The magic and the mechanics seem to work in a way that defies the known laws of both. You can't figure out how to disarm it.
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your body is wracked with pain, but your oath makes you a vessel of divine power. You are able to fight off the worst effects of the curse."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The curse is too powerful. It overwhelms your defenses and settles deep into your soul, weakening you."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your fingers are deft and light. The key is in your hand, and the guard snores on, oblivious."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The keys jingle loudly as you touch them. The guard's eyes snap open, and he immediately reaches for his weapon."
input: [CHECK]: Navigator's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You expertly guide the ship through the maze of sharp rocks, your instincts and knowledge of the sea proving invaluable."
input: [CHECK]: Navigator's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You misjudge the current. The ship scrapes against a sharp rock with a horrible grinding sound, tearing a hole in the hull."

input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You know of the treaty, but the specific details are fuzzy. You can't remember the exact clauses."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your bluff is utterly convincing. Your opponents fold one by one, leaving you to collect the massive pot with a worthless hand."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: A flicker of nervousness in your eye gives you away. Your main opponent calls your bluff, and you lose everything."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: As you focus, you can feel a faint but unmistakable aura of malevolence coming from the stranger. They are hiding a dark nature."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The stranger's soul is a closed book. You cannot sense any particular alignment, leaving you unsure of their intentions."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a series of deep gouges on the trees, all leading in the same direction. This is the beast's territory, and you are on the right track."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The forest is immense, and you find no signs of the beast's passage. You are effectively lost, with no trail to follow."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The official doesn't understand your power, but they see the chilling conviction in your eyes and decide it's not worth the risk to deny you. They quickly stamp your permit."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The official is a stubborn bureaucrat who is not impressed by vague threats. They dismiss you and call for the next person in line.
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You speak to your horse in a calm, firm voice. The horse, trusting you completely, steadies itself and stands ready for your command."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The chaos of the battle is too much for the horse. It rears up in terror, throwing you from the saddle, and gallops away from the fighting."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wall is thin, and you are able to make out every word of their secret conversation."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wall is too thick, and their voices are just a muffled murmur. You can't make out any of the words."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You notice the birds are flying low and the clouds on the horizon are a sure sign of a major storm coming in the next day or so.
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The weather patterns are unusually erratic. You are unable to make a reliable prediction.
input: [CHECK]: Alchemist's Supplies[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You carefully mix the volatile chemicals, and the resulting liquid bubbles and hisses. It's a potent acid that should do the trick."
input: [CHECK]: Alchemist's Supplies[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You mix the ingredients in the wrong proportions. The mixture gives off a puff of foul-smelling green smoke and then solidifies into a useless, rubbery sludge."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The captain is a cynic, but your unwavering conviction reminds them of why they joined the watch in the first place. They agree to help you."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The captain has seen too much to be moved by words of honor. 'Duty doesn't fill my men's pockets,' they say dismissively. 'I can't help you.'"
input: [CHECK]: Tinker's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You hastily assemble a contraption of tubes and magically-charged crystals. It sputters to life, producing a stream of breathable, albeit foul-tasting, air."
input: [CHECK]: Tinker's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your hastily built device fails to work. A few bubbles sputter out before it shorts with a fizzle, leaving you with even less time."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your booming, righteous voice draws a crowd. The merchant, fearing both your wrath and the anger of the onlookers, quickly packs up their stall and flees."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The merchant simply laughs, and the jaded crowd seems unbothered. 'One god is as good as another, paladin,' the merchant sneers. 'Now move along.'"
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your fingers and toes find purchase in the tiny cracks in the brickwork. You scramble up the wall with surprising speed, reaching the roof before the guards arrive."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wall is too smooth and slick with rain. You can't get a good grip and slide back down, cornered as the guards close in."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You can read the ice like a map, spotting the darker, thinner patches. You pick a safe path across the frozen river."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ice looks solid, but a loud crack echoes as you take your third step. You are plunged into the freezing water below."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your well-reasoned arguments and meticulously documented research allay their fears. The council grants you permission to continue your work.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your research touches on forbidden subjects, and the council is too conservative. They are blinded by fear and refuse to listen to your logic, ordering your research to be seized."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You subtly watch the others and mirror their actions, using the correct fork and sipping your wine at the appropriate times. You fit in perfectly."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You grab the wrong fork, causing a nearby duchess to gasp in horror. Your attempts to blend in have only made you stand out as a commoner."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice the knot is poorly tied. By shifting your weight back and forth, you are able to work it loose enough to slip one hand free."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The ropes are thick and the knots are expertly tied. There are no weak points; you are completely immobilized.
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the howl, though you hoped you'd never hear it. It's the cry of a Worg, a creature of supernatural evil and cunning."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The howl is unlike anything you've ever heard. It's a chilling sound from a creature completely outside your experience.
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are able to pick up fleeting images and emotions from the person's mind, giving you a clue as to their true intentions."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The person's mind is a fortress. You are met with a wall of mental static, unable to read anything."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your horse trusts you completely. It gallops to the edge and leaps, its powerful legs carrying you both safely to the other side."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The chasm is too wide, and the horse knows it. It skids to a halt at the edge, nearly throwing you into the abyss."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You move through the crowd like water flowing around rocks, never breaking stride as you keep your eyes locked on the fleeing thief."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The crowd is too dense. You are constantly blocked and jostled, and you quickly lose sight of the thief in the throng of people."

input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The local dance has a complex rhythm that you just can't seem to grasp. Your clumsy attempts are more comical than impressive, and you trip over your own feet."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You enter a state of prayer, and a divine vision is granted to you. You see the sickness not as a disease, but as a slow-acting curse originating from a tainted well."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You pray for guidance, but the heavens are silent. The nature of this sickness remains hidden from you, a frustrating and deadly mystery."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your aim is true. The grappling hook sails across the chasm and catches securely on a rock outcropping, allowing you to anchor a rope."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: You misjudge the wind. The grappling hook misses its mark and clatters uselessly into the depths of the chasm below. It is lost.
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You construct a careful facade of innocence and good intentions. The Paladin, while perhaps suspicious, has no reason to doubt your word and lets you pass."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The Paladin's divine sense allows them to feel the faint aura of your pact. 'There is a darkness about you, Warlock,' they say, their hand resting on their sword. 'Your words are hollow.'"

input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You focus, and a tiny mote of fire appears above the candle's wick, lighting it with a soft glow. No one notices."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your wild magic surges unpredictably. Instead of a tiny spark, a foot-long jet of flame shoots from your hand, startling everyone in the room."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You run towards the wall and then straight up it, your feet moving so fast they defy gravity. You easily reach the ledge above."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You get a few steps up the wall before gravity reasserts itself. You slide back down, unable to get the momentum you need."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the principles at work. It's a 'reality anchor,' a device designed to prevent teleportation magic from functioning in its vicinity."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The device is based on a magical principle you've never encountered before. Its function is a complete and frustrating mystery.
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The words of the Rite of Consecration come to you, clear and strong. You know the exact prayers and rituals needed to cleanse this place."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You know several rites of blessing, but the specific, powerful ritual for sanctifying a graveyard of this size eludes your memory."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You nudge the stack at its weakest point, and it collapses with a thunderous crash that echoes through the library, drawing the attention of the librarians."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You misjudge the physics of the stack. Instead of a loud crash, the books just slump over with a soft 'whumpf' that no one even notices."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The thorns tear at your skin, but you ignore the pain, pushing through the briar patch and emerging on the other side, bloodied but successful."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The thorns are unnaturally sharp and strong. They snag your clothes and armor, holding you fast. You are completely stuck."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the markings as being from the Third Dynasty of the Serpent Kings, making the artifact at least three thousand years old."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The markings are from a civilization you don't recognize. The artifact is clearly ancient, but you are unable to determine its precise age or origin."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sphinx's riddle is clever, but you've heard a variation of it before. You confidently give the correct answer, and the sphinx smiles, impressed."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The riddle is impossibly complex, based on a logic you can't comprehend. You give an answer, but the sphinx just shakes its head in disappointment."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your senses guide you not to the graveyard or the temple, but to the town well. You feel a cold, corrupting energy emanating from the water itself."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The entire village feels... off. There is a general sense of unease, but you cannot pinpoint any specific source of evil. It is hidden well."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are as still and silent as the tree itself. The patrol passes directly beneath you, completely unaware of your presence."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: A bird, startled by your presence, flies out of the tree with a loud squawk. The patrol immediately looks up and spots you."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The merchant is intrigued by your novel offer. It accepts the memory of your first kill as payment, a dark but valuable commodity."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The merchant is not a fool. 'Memories fade,' it rasps. 'A soul is eternal. Do not try to swindle me. The price is the price.'"
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You execute a perfect disarming maneuver, your blade locking with theirs and a quick twist of your wrist sending their sword flying."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your opponent anticipates your move. They sidestep your disarming attempt and counter-attack, putting you on the defensive."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You wave your hand, and a beautiful, shimmering whirlwind of dust and light dances in the air, delighting the child."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your magic surges, and the small whirlwind becomes a violent gust of wind that kicks up a cloud of dirt and makes the child cry."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice a very faint, oily sheen on the surface of the tea and a smell that is slightly off. It is definitely poisoned."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tea looks and smells perfectly normal. If there is a poison in it, it is a very subtle and expertly made one."
input: [CHECK]: Tinker's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You create a set of exquisitely crafted lockpicks, including several experimental designs that should be able to bypass most common locks."
input: [CHECK]: Tinker's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You try to work with a new, stronger alloy, but it is too brittle. Your finest lockpick shatters in your hand during the final stage of crafting."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The soldier, who expected to be executed, is moved by your offer of mercy. They tell you everything they know in exchange for fair treatment."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The soldier is a zealot, completely devoted to their cause. They spit at your offer of mercy and refuse to say a word."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The message is a complex mix of slang and code, but you are fluent in this language. You are able to decipher the message's hidden meaning."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: This is a regional dialect of thieves' cant that you are not familiar with. You can only understand a few of the words.
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You rig a massive deadfall trap. When the beast passes through, the trap springs perfectly, and the heavy log slams down on it."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tripwire snaps before the trap can be fully sprung. The log falls, but it misses the beast completely."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You experiment with a few common command words, and one of them causes the item to hum with power. You have found the word."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The command word is likely a unique and personal one. Your attempts to activate it with common words all fail.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: The seneschal is so charmed by your wit and flattery that they agree to squeeze you into the noble's busy schedule.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The seneschal is a stuffy and officious individual who is immune to your charms. They tell you to submit a formal request in writing, which will be reviewed in a few months."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the tell-tale signs of a magical blight: the plants are not just dying, they are actively decaying and corrupting the soil around them."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The crops are dying from a mundane cause, likely a lack of water or a nutrient-poor soil. There is no sign of any magical interference."

input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The prophecy is written in a series of cryptic and confusing metaphors. You are unable to make any sense of it.
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You have a perfect sense of your horse's stamina. You urge it on at the perfect moments, and you cross the finish line just ahead of your rival."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You push your horse too hard, too early. It runs out of steam in the final stretch and is easily overtaken."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You carry yourself with an air of effortless authority that the guard doesn't dare to question. They bow and let you pass.
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You may be charismatic, but you don't know the first thing about acting like a noble. The guard sees right through your act."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You move with a beautiful, deadly grace, effortlessly dodging the blades and weaving through the traps as if it were a dance."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You dodge the first blade, but you are not fast enough for the second. It catches your arm, leaving a deep gash."
input: [CHECK]: Poisoner's Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You create a potent but non-lethal sedative that will put a person to sleep for several hours with just a single drop.
input: [CHECK]: Poisoner's Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: You get the formula wrong. The resulting potion is a weak stimulant that would have a hard time putting a cat to sleep.
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You see the tell-tale signs: a faint sulfurous smell, an aversion to holy symbols, and a second voice whispering behind their own. They are possessed."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The person is clearly disturbed, but you see no signs of demonic possession. They are likely suffering from a mundane, if severe, mental illness."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You subtly flick your wrist, and a patch of ground in front of the thief becomes impossibly slick. His feet go out from under him, and he tumbles to the ground, scattering the stolen coins."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your wild magic surges, creating not a small patch, but a large, messy slush puddle that trips up several innocent shoppers but completely misses the nimble thief."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find your center, and the howling wind and biting cold become distant sensations. You are able to cross the ledge with perfect focus and calm."
input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The cold is too intense, seeping into your bones and shattering your concentration. The fear of falling floods your mind, and you are forced to crawl back to safety."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You wind up the bird, and it sings a beautiful, complex melody. The patron is delighted by the exquisite craftsmanship and agrees to fund your workshop."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: A gear inside the songbird jams. Instead of a beautiful melody, it produces a series of horrible screeching and grinding noises before falling silent. The patron is unimpressed."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You channel the sun's righteous fire into the blade. The evil aura shrieks and dissipates, leaving a clean, masterfully crafted longsword in your hands."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The evil in the sword is ancient and powerful. It resists your attempt to cleanse it, and you are thrown back by a wave of necrotic energy."

input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Their masks and the dim lighting make it impossible to read their lips clearly. You can only catch a few words, not enough to understand their conversation."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Surprisingly, your simple method works. The book of northern legends has a prominent embossed bear on its cover, and you spot it on a high shelf."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: There are thousands of leather-bound books, and the library's classification system is a complete mystery to you. You are hopelessly lost in the stacks."
input: [CHECK]: Cartographer's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice the cartographer used a type of ink that was only invented 20 years ago, but the map is supposedly 200 years old. It is a definite forgery."
input: [CHECK]: Cartographer's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The map is either a masterful forgery or it is genuine. The cartography style, ink, and parchment are all consistent with the period it claims to be from."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your juggling is clumsy, but that's what makes it funny. The children erupt in a fit of giggles, their sadness forgotten."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You accidentally drop one of the juggling balls, and it hits a younger child in the head, who immediately starts to cry. This has made things worse."

input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The plague spread too fast. It's impossible to determine who the first case was, which makes it much harder to understand its origin and nature."
input: [CHECK]: Poisoner's Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With steady hands, you carefully extract the potent venom from the spider's fangs, enough to coat a dozen arrows."
input: [CHECK]: Poisoner's Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You accidentally puncture the venom sac, and the sticky, toxic liquid spills onto the ground, completely wasted."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: A wave of alien knowledge fills your mind. This is the 'Chained Star,' a constellation that is only visible when the barriers between worlds are thin."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your patron is silent. The stars are beyond even its knowledge, or it simply doesn't care to share their secrets with you."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You push the pillar at its weakest point. With a deep groan, the massive stone column topples over, creating a perfect barricade."

input: [CHECK]: Constitution[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Exhaustion is a powerful foe. In the darkest hour of the night, you drift off to sleep, your vigil incomplete and the vision denied."
input: [CHECK]: Stonemasonry Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You notice an area where the mortar is crumbling and the stones are poorly fitted. A siege engine striking that spot would bring the wall down easily.
input: [CHECK]: Stonemasonry Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The castle was built by master craftsmen. The stonework is flawless, and you cannot find any discernible weak points in the wall."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ghost, weary of its long and lonely existence, agrees to help you, seeing you as its only hope for finding peace."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ghost is too consumed by its own sorrow to trust you. It just weeps and fades through the wall, leaving you with no answers."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The water pools and then drains into a nearly invisible seam around one of the tiles, revealing the outline of a pressure plate."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The floor is perfectly level and seamless. The water just forms a puddle, giving you no clues as to any potential traps."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wolf meets your gaze, sees the iron will of a superior predator, and backs down, slinking away into the woods."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your lack of fear is seen not as dominance, but as a challenge. The wolf lowers its head and growls, preparing to attack."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your hand is as steady as a rock. You perfectly replicate every curve and line of the complex rune, and it begins to glow with power."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your hand trembles slightly, and one of the lines in your copy is just a fraction of an inch off. The rune remains inert, a powerless doodle."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The dragon is so charmed and flattered by your song that it laughs, a sound like an avalanche, and agrees to your request, seeing it as a grand jest."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The dragon is not a creature of whimsy. It sees your song as an insult to the perfection of its hoard and unleashes a warning blast of fire over your head.
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You see that the flesh around the wound is unnaturally black and cold, and it resists your healing magic. This was definitely caused by a cursed weapon."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: It is a grievous wound, but it seems to be a perfectly natural one. There is no sign of any dark magic at play."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice a faint breeze and the way the rocks are eroded, signs that point to a nearby opening to the surface. You find your way out."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The cave system is a bewildering, unnatural maze. Your natural instincts are useless here, and you wander for hours, completely lost."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: A whisper of forbidden knowledge enters your mind, giving you the answer to the ancient riddle. The lock clicks open."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your patron's mind does not work in riddles and logic. The answer it gives you is a confusing, non-sequitur that is of no help at all."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your unwavering conviction and the logic of your plan win them over. They agree to follow you, despite the risks."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Your fellow knights are too cautious. They believe your plan is reckless and will lead to a needless loss of life. They refuse to follow you.
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You instinctively shape the air beneath you, creating a powerful updraft that slows your fall to a gentle drift, allowing you to land safely."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your control slips, and instead of an updraft, you create a chaotic blast of wind that sends you tumbling through the air, completely out of control."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your movements are so light that you barely disturb the snow. You cross the field, leaving no trace of your passage."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The snow is too soft and deep. Even with your incredible discipline, you leave a clear set of tracks behind you."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The device whirs to life! When you hold it to your ear, the foreign language you hear is instantly translated into words you can understand."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You make a mistake in the enchanting process. The device translates everything, but it's always into the wrong language, making it completely useless."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You hold up your holy symbol, and it blazes with a light the creature cannot bear. It shrieks and recoils, its evil nature momentarily cowed by your divine authority."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The creature is ancient and powerful, and it is not impressed by what it calls the 'false light' of your god. Your attempt to intimidate it only makes it angrier."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice that one of the goblets has a tiny, almost invisible scratch on its base, likely a mark left by the person who placed the antidote."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The goblets are perfectly identical in every way. There are no marks, no temperature differences, nothing to distinguish one from another."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the subtle signs of a burrow hidden beneath a snowdrift. You dig down and are able to catch a rabbit for your dinner.
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tundra is a vast, empty expanse of snow. You search for hours but find no signs of any animal life."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your illusion is perfect, down to the last detail of the officer's uniform and the stern expression on their face. The guard is completely fooled."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: You get a small detail wrong—the insignia on the officer's uniform is from the wrong regiment. The guard immediately recognizes it as a fake and sounds the alarm.
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The dwarves' eyes light up when they hear the familiar tune. They join in with gusto, their deep voices echoing in the tavern."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You play the song with technical skill, but you lack the heart. The dwarves just stare at you, unimpressed by your 'flowery elven interpretation' of their song."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: The image comes to you: a silver sun with a weeping eye at its center. It is the symbol of a long-dead god of sorrowful endings.
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: There are thousands of dead gods, and their symbols are a confusing jumble in your memory. You cannot recall this specific one."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You become one with the swamp. You are so well hidden that a giant snake slithers right past you without noticing your presence.
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your camouflage is good, but not good enough. A keen-eyed predator spots your movement and begins to stalk you."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ghost sees the maddening, alien form of your patron in its mind's eye. It becomes terrified and immediately tells you everything it knows."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ghost is already a creature of terror and despair. It is not impressed by your patron and simply fades away, refusing to speak with you."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You see a series of deep, spiderweb cracks in the foundation and notice the whole building is leaning slightly to one side. It is not safe and could collapse at any moment."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The building seems to have weathered the earthquake remarkably well. You see a few plaster cracks, but the foundation and main structure appear to be completely sound."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You speak to the elemental not in words, but in feelings of heat and light. The elemental, recognizing you as a kindred spirit, agrees to quell its flames and return to its home plane."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Your attempts to communicate with the elemental are clumsy. It misinterprets your magical 'words' as a challenge and becomes even more enraged and destructive.
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your focus is absolute. You are able to find the center of gravity for each stone, creating an impossible, beautiful tower of perfectly balanced rocks."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: A slight tremor in your hand, or perhaps a gust of wind, is enough to upset the delicate balance. The tower of stones comes crashing down."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You create a 'Lens of True Sight.' When you light the lantern, its beam reveals the shimmering outlines of invisible objects and creatures."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You grind the crystal incorrectly, and it fails to focus the magic properly. The result is just a normal lantern that gives off a faint, purple light."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The person claims to be a faithful follower of the Sun God, but your divine sense tells you their soul is cold and dark. They are lying."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The person seems to be a genuine and devout follower. If they are lying, their faith in their own deception is strong enough to fool your divine sense."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The elemental, sensing your innate connection to its element, agrees. It will imbue one item with fire for you if you break its bonds."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The elemental is too enraged by its captivity to listen. It lashes out with fiery tendrils, seeing you as just another captor."

input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The text is too small and the lighting is too poor. You are unable to make out the words from such a distance.
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You point out that the riddle is based on a false premise and is thus unsolvable. The sphinx, impressed by your logic rather than a correct answer, allows you to pass."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The riddle is magical in nature and does not adhere to mundane logic. Your attempts to deconstruct it are meaningless, and the sphinx looks bored."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You channel your pure, righteous faith, and it acts as a key, bypassing the corrupted holy defenses and allowing you to strike the phylactery."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The lich was a cleric in its former life, and its holy aura is a twisted mockery of your own faith. The two forces cancel each other out, and the phylactery remains protected."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The smuggler's eyes go wide with fear and anger. In his panicked denial, he lets slip a key detail about a recent shipment to a hidden cove."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The smuggler just laughs. 'Oldest trick in the book,' he says. 'You'll have to do better than that to get anything from me.'"
input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You feel naked without your axe, but you control your anxiety. You recognize that your hands and your wits can be weapons too, and you proceed with caution."
input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The lack of your axe makes you feel intensely vulnerable and angry. You are agitated and overly aggressive to everyone you meet, drawing unwanted attention."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you don't understand the words, your innate understanding of magic allows you to shape the spell correctly. It works, though you're not sure how."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your mispronunciation of a single syllable has disastrous results. The spell backfires, engulfing you in a cloud of harmless, slimy, green goo."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You play a beautiful, evocative piece of music that tells a clear story of love, loss, and hope. The silent monks are moved to tears."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your music is pleasant, but without words, it is just a series of nice sounds. The intended story is completely lost on the monks."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The children are wary, but the genuine kindness in your eyes and the offer of food is enough to win them over. They cautiously approach you."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The children have learned that nothing is free. They see your offer as a trap, snatch the bread, and then disappear back into the darkness."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You carefully scrape a large amount of the moss into your pouch. Wrapping it around your boots should make you almost completely silent.
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The moss is unexpectedly tough. Your knife makes a loud scraping sound against the stone wall, a noise that is doubly loud in the otherwise silent cavern."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You ignore the horrifying visions and focus on the reflections themselves. You notice one mirror that shows you exactly as you are. That is the exit.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Every mirror shows a different, equally horrifying vision. You are unable to tell which are illusions and which might be the real future, leaving you lost and terrified."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You dip your dagger into the wine when no one is looking. A dark tarnish immediately appears on the silver. The wine is definitely poisoned.
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: As you dip your dagger into the wine, a nearby noble notices the action. 'What are you doing?' they ask loudly, drawing the attention of the entire table."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You pull the heat from the flames, and the fire dies with a soft hiss, leaving behind a pile of cold, unburnt wood."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your control slips, and you accidentally fuel the fire with a surge of elemental energy. The campfire erupts into a massive bonfire."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice a slight tensing in his jaw when he is about to make an aggressive move, which allows you to prepare a counter-attack. You win the game."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The strategist is completely unreadable, a perfect stone mask. You can get no clues from his demeanor and are easily outmaneuvered."
input: [CHECK]: Alchemist's Supplies[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: After a series of tests, you determine the liquid is a very rare form of magical coolant, often used in the construction of high-powered magical constructs."
input: [CHECK]: Alchemist's Supplies[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The liquid is completely inert and reacts to none of your tests. Its composition is a total mystery, though it does taste faintly of lemon."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ghost, which was tied to this world by a sense of duty, finally understands that its work is done. It gives you a grateful nod and fades away into a peaceful light."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ghost is bound by a powerful curse, not a sense of duty. Your words of peace mean nothing to it, and it remains trapped in this world."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Instead of using your hands, you expertly brace your feet against the wall and your back against the rope, shimmying up without needing to grip it."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The grease is too thick. Every time you try to get a grip, your hands and feet just slide off, and you are unable to climb."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The thunderous, hypnotic beat of your drum captivates the audience. They are filled with a primal energy and declare you the winner by acclamation."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You have a powerful rhythm, but no sense of melody or showmanship. The crowd is briefly interested but is ultimately won over by a lute player with more flair."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your scrying is successful. You see a brief image of the archmage, old and withered, sitting on a throne of black ice in a frozen wasteland."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your spell is immediately blocked by a powerful anti-scrying ward. You not only fail to find the archmage, but you are certain he is now aware of your attempt."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You deliver a toast that sounds like high praise to everyone else, but your target recognizes the subtle insult and their face flushes with anger."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your insult is too subtle. Your target takes it as a genuine compliment, and the person you were trying to impress with your wit is just confused."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You focus your senses and can feel a cold, dead aura emanating from the twin on the right. That is the creature of the night."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The vampire is using a powerful magical amulet to mask its undead nature. Both twins feel like living, breathing mortals to your divine sense."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You account for the wind, take a steadying breath, and release. The arrow flies true, splitting the apple perfectly in half without harming the person."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your nerve breaks at the last second, and you pull the shot just a hair. The arrow misses the apple and the person completely, thudding into the tree behind them."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You realize the creature is using a complex color-based grammar. You are able to decipher its basic meaning and communicate with it.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The colors shift in a chaotic, mesmerizing pattern that seems to have no logic or meaning. You are unable to communicate with the creature."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You recall reading that the castle's architect was famous for including secret passages. You remember a detail about a passage behind a specific tapestry in the main hall.
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You have studied many famous castles, but you have no specific knowledge of this one. You don't know where any secret passages might be."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guard captain, who was initially hostile, suddenly finds you to be a very reasonable and trustworthy person. They agree to your request."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guard captain is a highly disciplined veteran with a strong will. They recognize your attempt at magical manipulation and become even more hostile, drawing their weapon."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You run along one wall, leap to the other, snatch the key, and land back where you started, all without touching the trapped floor."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You manage to run along the first wall, but your leap to the second wall falls short. You land heavily on the trapped floor, triggering a loud alarm."
input: [CHECK]: Woodcarver's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are able to lash the logs together in a way that creates a stable, buoyant platform capable of carrying you and your companions safely across the river."
input: [CHECK]: Woodcarver's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Your design is too ambitious for the materials at hand. The raft is unstable and begins to come apart as soon as you put it in the water.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: When you reach out with your senses, you are hit with a wave of pure malevolence. The object is not just cursed, it is a vessel for a powerful evil entity."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The artifact is ancient and powerful, but your divine sense detects no evil in it. It appears to be safe."
input: [CHECK]: Poisoner's Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the bitter, almond-like taste of Cyanide, a fast-acting and deadly poison."
input: [CHECK]: Poisoner's Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The poison has no taste at all, which is in itself a terrifying discovery. You have no idea what it is, only that it is expertly made."
input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You feel a flash of rage, but you master it. You know that a tavern brawl is a fool's errand. You turn your back on the man and finish your drink."
input: [CHECK]: Wisdom[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The insult is too much to bear. Your honor demands satisfaction. You let out a roar of rage and flip the table, challenging the man to a fight."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are able to impose your will on the chaotic magic. Your spell works as intended, without any strange side effects."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wild magic overwhelms your spell. Instead of a fireball, you summon a shower of harmless blue frogs."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your sonnet is a masterpiece of meter and metaphor. The audience is spellbound, and you easily win the contest."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Your poem is full of cliches and forced rhymes. The audience gives you a polite but unenthusiastic round of applause.
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You know the text was written by a specific sect from a specific era, which allows you to ignore most of the library and focus your search on a single, dusty wing. You find the book."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The library is a chaotic mess, with books from a hundred different faiths and sects all mixed together. Your specialized knowledge is of no use here."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The night is clear, and you easily spot the North Star, allowing you to determine which way is north and get your bearings."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sky is overcast, and you cannot see the stars. You have no way of knowing which direction is which."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your display of power and your strange, prophetic words are enough to convince the cultists. They kneel before you, believing you to be a chosen one."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your magic is impressive, but your knowledge of their dogma is flawed. The cult's high priest denounces you as a heretic and an impostor."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You see in the soldier's eyes not fanaticism, but fear and doubt. Their loyalty is to their comrades, not their king. They can be turned."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The soldier is a true believer in their cause. You see nothing but unwavering loyalty in their eyes. They will never betray their kingdom.
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You gather the moisture in the air and are able to create a small, intense rain shower that douses the flames."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are unable to gather enough moisture from the hot, dry air. Your spell produces only a weak, misty drizzle that does nothing to stop the fire."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your hand is a blur. The chopsticks snap together, and you have caught the fly by its wings, completely unharmed."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The fly is impossibly fast, and it easily evades your attempts to catch it, buzzing mockingly around your head."
input: [CHECK]: Alchemist's Supplies[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You create a sovereign glue, a magical substance that can permanently bond any two objects together."
input: [CHECK]: Alchemist's Supplies[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You create an incredibly effective solvent instead. The beaker you were using to mix it dissolves, and the contents spill all over your work table."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You channel your divine might into your weapon. The resulting blow is so powerful that it shatters the magical chain into a thousand pieces.
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The chain is made of a strange, magic-resistant metal. Your divinely empowered strike does nothing but create a few sparks."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: They take the bait completely, believing your fabricated intelligence. Their strategic position now seems weaker, and they agree to the truce."
input: [CHECK]: Deception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The faction leader is a shrewd tactician and sees a flaw in your 'intelligence.' They realize you are playing them and become hostile to both you and the other side.
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You remember reading that the knight always relies on a powerful opening lunge but has poor footing when forced to backpedal. You know how to counter them.
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The knight's legend is great, but the actual details of their fights are scarce and contradictory. You have no tactical information to go on."
input: [CHECK]: Charisma[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You focus your will, and the dream-stuff coalesces into a shimmering sword of pure energy in your hand. The dreamscape is subject to your imagination."
input: [CHECK]: Charisma[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your grip on the dream is too weak. You try to imagine a sword, but it appears as a limp, useless noodle. The dreamer's subconscious is stronger than yours."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You sit in silence, providing a calm, non-judgmental presence. The ghost, sensing your empathy, finally unburdens its centuries of sorrow and finds peace."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your silence is seen not as empathy, but as cold indifference. The ghost becomes agitated and hostile, its sorrow turning to rage."
input: [CHECK]: Tinker's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You quickly assemble a spring-loaded device that launches a weighted net. You take aim and fire, neatly capturing the flying tome."
input: [CHECK]: Tinker's Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your device is too powerful. It launches the net with such force that it slams the book against the far wall, damaging its delicate spine."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a worn teddy bear with a hidden locket containing a picture of their parents, hinting that a past tragedy is the source of their evil."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The room is sterile and empty, cleaned of all personal effects long ago. The villain's past remains a closed book."
input: [CHECK]: Dice Set[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ghost, bound by the rules of the game it created, does not notice your cheating. You easily win the high-stakes game."
input: [CHECK]: Dice Set[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The dice pass right through the ghost's spectral hand. It seems mortal cheating has no effect on the ethereal plane. You are forced to play fairly.
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You place your hand on the ground and can feel a slow, rhythmic vibration, like a massive heart beating faster. The turtle is definitely stirring."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The tremors feel like normal geological activity. You can't sense any sign of life from the great creature beneath your feet.
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You focus your mind, and the swirling patterns in the crystal resolve into legible text. You are able to read the strange, crystalline book."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The crystal's frequency is too chaotic. Trying to read it gives you a splitting headache and fills your mind with confusing, discordant images."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The baker, intrigued by your offer and seeing a way to attract more customers, agrees. The situation is defused, and the orphan gets to eat."

input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: The guards witness your casual display of incredible strength and decide that engaging you is not worth the risk. They lower their weapons and let you pass.
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guards are professionals who are not easily impressed by brute strength. They see your display not as a threat, but as a sign of aggression, and they ready their shields."

input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you are not a scholar, you are able to understand the simple map. The big red X is probably the treasure."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The map is a confusing jumble of lines and symbols. You can't make heads or tails of it and are holding it upside down.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You spot a tiny, almost invisible wire connected to the lock. If the lock is picked, it will trigger a needle trap. You have found the trap."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The trap mechanism is expertly hidden inside the chest's walls. You see no external signs of it and declare the chest safe.
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You cast the spell with precision. The torn fibers of the page knit themselves back together, leaving no trace of the damage."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your spell is a bit too powerful. The page is repaired, but the magical energy chars the delicate, ancient ink, rendering the text unreadable."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You create a shimmering dome of golden light that protects the crowd from falling debris. Your display of divine protection calms their fears.
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The earthquake is a natural disaster, not an evil force. Your protective spells, designed to ward off evil, have no effect, and the crowd remains in a panic."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your cold, hard stare speaks volumes. You've seen real battle, and the tough guy, who has not, recognizes you as a true killer. He backs down."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tough guy mistakes your silence for weakness. He laughs and shoves you, escalating the confrontation."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize the distinctive, three-note call of the Mountain Finch, a bird that only lives at high altitudes. You know you are getting close to the peak."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You've never heard a bird sing like that before. It's a beautiful, but completely unfamiliar, song."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You know to look for dry wood on the underside of fallen logs and in the hollows of trees. You are able to get a small, sputtering fire started."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Everything is completely soaked. You are unable to find any wood dry enough to catch a spark, and you are left cold and wet."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your paranoia pays off. In the reflection, you see the same person you saw on the last three streets, trying to act inconspicuous. You are definitely being followed."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The street behind you is a normal, bustling crowd of people. No one seems to be paying you any special attention."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your spell reveals that only one of the items in the room radiates a true, powerful magical aura. You have found the genuine article."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The trickster who created this room was clever. All of the items have been enchanted with a weak, illusionary magic. Your spell reveals that they are all magical, which is of no help at all."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your words stir a long-forgotten spark of faith in the priest's cynical heart. They break down in tears, confessing their sins and begging for redemption."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The priest has fallen too far. They see their faith as a tool for power, not a path to righteousness. They laugh at your naive beliefs."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You can tell by the sheer number of overlapping tracks and the way they have churned up the ground that this was a large force, at least a hundred strong."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The enemy used a narrow, rocky path where they left few tracks. You can tell they passed this way, but you have no way of knowing their numbers."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: After several days of patient work, the hawk begins to accept you. It eats from your hand and allows you to stroke its feathers. You have a new companion."
input: [CHECK]: Animal Handling[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The hawk is too proud and wild to be tamed. It accepts your food, but it makes it clear it is no one's pet and eventually flies away."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a series of mighty, earth-shaking blows, you smash a hole in the stone wall big enough to climb through."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wall was built by dwarven masons. Your blows barely chip the stone, and you succeed only in exhausting yourself."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The trash catches quickly, creating a large amount of smoke and a small, attention-grabbing fire. It's the perfect distraction."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The trash is too damp to catch fire. Your attempt to create a distraction fails, and you are left with nothing but a few wisps of smoke."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your 'Silence' spell is perfectly placed. You are able to pass through the ward without triggering the magical alarm, which has been rendered mute."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ward is more powerful than a simple 'Silence' spell. It not only triggers a loud alarm, but it also dispels your spell, leaving you exposed."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The person is caught within the spell's effect. They struggle to lie, but they are magically compelled to tell you the truth."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The person is a powerful spellcaster themselves, and they are able to resist your spell. They look at you with a smug grin, free to continue their lies."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You create a defensible camp, using the natural terrain to your advantage and setting up tripwires and alarms. You will not be caught by surprise."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are not in a good tactical position. You do your best, but your camp remains vulnerable to a surprise attack."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You notice the fog is thickest in a certain direction and that it seems to originate from a single point in a nearby swamp. You are on the right track.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The fog is everywhere, a thick, disorienting blanket that seems to have no source or direction. You are hopelessly lost within it."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you don't understand a word, the actors' passionate performances and clear body language allow you to follow the basic story of love and betrayal."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The play is a complex political satire, and most of the humor is in the witty dialogue. The story is completely lost on you, and you are just confused."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your performance is flawless. The guard, who sees servants come and go all day, doesn't give you a second look and waves you through."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your accent is all wrong, and your clothes are too fine for a servant. The guard is immediately suspicious and stops you for questioning."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are able to recall the 'Theory of Sympathetic Vibration,' an obscure magical principle that is the key to solving your current problem."
input: [CHECK]: History[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Even your incredible memory has its limits. The theory is too obscure, and you are unable to recall its details."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You feel a gentle, warm, and distinctly holy aura coming from the well water. This is a sacred site."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The well water feels perfectly normal. It is just a well, with no holy or unholy properties."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You expertly use your stool to block the incoming chair, the sound of wood smashing against wood echoing in the tavern. You are unharmed."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The chair is heavier than it looks. It smashes through your improvised shield and sends you staggering back.
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a narrow ravine with a high ledge, the perfect spot to rain arrows down on the goblins as they pass through. They'll never see it coming."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The terrain is open and flat, offering no good places to hide. You'll have to face the goblins on even terms."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air is cold and stale. Before you is a massive, sealed stone door covered in faded carvings. The silence is absolute."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a powerful heave, you manage to grind the stone door open just enough to slip through. It was incredibly heavy."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You put all your might into it, but the stone door doesn't budge an inch. It's sealed by more than just its own weight."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your keen eyes notice that one of the carved snakes has a depression in its eye. It looks like a hidden button or keyhole.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The carvings are ancient and worn, but they seem purely decorative. You can't find any seams, buttons, or locks."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a series of delicate clicks, you feel the tumblers align. A heavy grinding sound echoes as the stone door slowly slides open, revealing a dark corridor."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The lock's mechanism is ancient and rusted. Your pick snaps off inside it with a sharp 'ping', jamming the lock permanently. The door is now impossible to open this way."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your battle-honed senses are on high alert. You notice the faint glint of a tripwire about ankle-height, 20 feet down the corridor."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The corridor seems eerily still and silent. The air is heavy with the smell of dust and decay, but you don't see or hear any immediate danger."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your instincts were right. You notice one flagstone is slightly less dusty than the others. A gentle prod with a dagger confirms it's a pressure plate for a trap.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You examine the floor, but the flagstones all seem equally ancient and uneven. You don't spot any signs of a trap mechanism."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice that the lid of the sarcophagus is connected to a series of wires, which in turn lead to dart-holes in the surrounding walls. It's a poison dart trap."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sarcophagus is covered in intricate carvings, but you see no external signs of any traps or triggers. It looks safe to open."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a steady hand, you carefully cut the wires connecting the lid to the dart mechanism. The trap is now disabled."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your tool slips and you accidentally trigger the mechanism! Darts shoot out from the walls, narrowly missing the party but making it clear the trap is still very much active."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a mighty shove, the heavy stone lid grinds and then slides off the sarcophagus, revealing the mummified remains and treasures within."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You draw, aim, and release in one smooth motion. The arrow flies true and splits the noble's own arrow, which was already in the bullseye. The crowd gasps."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your shot is slightly off. The arrow strikes the outer ring with a disappointing thud, earning a smug laugh from the noble."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You notice one of the poets places a strange emphasis on every fourth word. It's a simple substitution cipher, and you are able to understand the secret message being passed."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The poetry is overly dramatic and painfully boring. You can't discern any hidden meanings, only bad metaphors and forced rhymes."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You don't have the strength of a brawler, but you know exactly where to strike. A single, well-placed jab to a nerve cluster in your opponent's neck sends them to the floor."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: Your opponent is a mountain of muscle and shrugs off your precise-but-weak strike. They grab you in a painful bear hug.
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ghost, which had been hiding in the shadows, is drawn to your holy light. It sees you not as a threat, but as a source of comfort."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your holy light is too bright, too pure. The ghost, a creature of shadow, recoils from it in pain and vanishes completely."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You expertly dodge and weave through the falling debris, narrowly avoiding being crushed as you race towards the exit."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: A large rock clips your leg as it falls, sending you sprawling. You are injured, and the exit is now blocked by a massive pile of rubble."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You overhear two nobles whispering about the 'scandalous' meeting your target is having in the east garden. You have your next location.
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The gossip is a whirlwind of meaningless flattery and political maneuvering. You can't glean any useful information from the noise.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: After much confusion, you realize the books are organized by the author's height. Being tall, you find the book you need on a high shelf."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The indexing system is a confusing mess of numbers and letters. You give up and decide to just start pulling books off shelves at random.
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your hands are faster than their eyes. You expertly deal yourself a winning hand, and the cheat is none the wiser."
input: [CHECK]: Sleight of Hand[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The other player is a master cheat, and they spot your clumsy attempt. 'I wouldn't try that if I were you,' they say with a dangerous smile, revealing a hidden dagger."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You give a well-reasoned, academic answer about the Weave and the nature of arcane power. The door, apparently a magical construct from a fellow academic, swings open."
input: [CHECK]: Intelligence[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You give a technically correct answer, but the door was created by a wild mage and was expecting a more 'artistic' response. It remains shut."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize this as a sign of a martyr's sorrow, a holy sign that a great injustice has been committed here. It is a call for a champion."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Weeping statues are not a known sign in your faith. It could be a trick, a dark omen, or a miracle. You have no way of knowing for sure."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Surprisingly, your disciplined footwork translates well to the formal dance. You are not graceful, but you are precise and do not step on your partner's toes."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Dancing and fighting are not the same. You are clumsy and stiff, and you repeatedly step on your noble partner's feet, much to their annoyance."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: It takes a great deal of time and effort, but your knowledge of the right woods and techniques pays off. You are able to create a small ember and nurture it into a fire."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wood is too damp, or you are not skilled enough in the technique. You work for an hour but are left with nothing but blisters on your hands."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: With a mighty heave, you are able to bend the iron axle back into a roughly correct shape. The wheel can now be reattached."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The axle is made of solid iron. You are incredibly strong, but you cannot bend metal with your bare hands. The wagon remains broken."
input: [CHECK]: Poisoner's Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You carefully mix the correct reagents, creating a potent sedative that will put a person to sleep for several hours with just a single drop."
input: [CHECK]: Poisoner's Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You get the formula wrong. The resulting potion is not a sedative, but a weak stimulant that would have a hard time putting a cat to sleep."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: The spell is successful. The creature's strange clicks and whistles resolve into a complex language. It is definitely sentient and is trying to communicate.
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The spell reveals that the creature's noises are just that: noises. It has no language and is not sentient, merely a clever animal."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your heartfelt plea finds a spark of goodness in the merchant's cynical heart. He grudgingly agrees to make a small donation to the local orphanage.
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The merchant is completely unmoved. 'If the poor wanted to have money, they should have worked harder,' he says, and dismisses you."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You spot a section of the room where a series of overturned tables and a single pillar create a perfect, defensible bottleneck."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The room is a tactical nightmare. It's wide open, with no cover and multiple entrances. There is no good place to make a stand."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You recognize these as 'Glimmercaps,' a rare and delicious type of edible mushroom."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You've never seen mushrooms like this before. Their sickly green color and strange smell suggest they are probably poisonous, but you can't be sure."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your throw is so powerful that the dart sinks into the board up to the fletching, splitting the bullseye in two. You win."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your throw is too powerful. The dart misses the board entirely and punches a hole in the tavern wall, much to the owner's annoyance."
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: It's a disgusting but effective tactic. Your own scent is completely masked by the overwhelming stench of the garbage pile.
input: [CHECK]: Stealth[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You now smell like garbage, but the creature can still pick out your unique scent from underneath the filth. It is still able to track you."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your hand passes right through the wall as if it were smoke. It is a powerful and convincing illusion.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your hand meets solid, cold stone. If this is an illusion, it is a perfect one, completely indistinguishable from a real wall."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a tiny, almost invisible puncture mark on the person's neck and notice their blood is unnaturally thin. This was a fast-acting poison."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: There are no wounds, no signs of illness, no marks of any kind on the body. It's as if the person simply lay down and died. The cause of death is a complete mystery."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You duck under the blow with lightning speed. The bottle smashes against the wall behind you, and you come up ready to counter-attack."
input: [CHECK]: Acrobatics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are not as fast as you used to be. The bottle glances off the side of your head, leaving you dazed and seeing stars."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your pole sinks into a soft patch of ground just ahead of you. You've found a patch of quicksand and are able to safely navigate around it.
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ground seems solid, but as you take your next step, you sink up to your waist in a hidden patch of thick, grasping mud."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The goblin is terrified of you. It babbles everything it knows about its tribe's plans, begging you to let it go."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The goblin is either very brave or very stupid. It just spits at you and refuses to say a word.
input: [CHECK]: Forgery Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your forgery is a work of art. The handwriting is perfect, and you've even managed to replicate the noble's personal wax seal."
input: [CHECK]: Forgery Kit[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your handwriting is good, but you don't have the correct type of parchment. The forgery would not pass a close inspection."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You mention that you are a scholar seeking its knowledge. The ghost's curiosity overcomes its shyness, and it materializes before you, eager to speak."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ghost is too timid. Your presence is overwhelming, and it fades away, unwilling to speak with you."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You recall the 'Canticle of Pure Water' from your studies. You know the words and rituals needed to bless the well.
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You know several general prayers of blessing, but the specific, powerful ritual for consecrating a water source eludes you."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You notice several frayed ropes and a large crack in one of the main support beams. The bridge is not safe and will likely collapse.
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The bridge looks old and weathered, but the main supports seem solid. It should be safe to cross."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tracks are sharp and clear, and the mud inside them is still wet. The creature passed this way within the last hour."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tracks are faded and filled with rainwater. They could be a day old, or a week. It's impossible to tell."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: Before you lies the Ashenwood. The trees are bone-white and twisted into silent, screaming shapes. A strange grey dust coats everything, and the air is unnervingly still."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You stand on a floating island of black glass under a sky of swirling purple and green nebulae. In the distance, other islands drift, some with impossible architecture."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air in the sewers is thick with the stench of decay. Your lantern light reflects off slick, moss-covered brick walls that stretch into oppressive darkness."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ballroom is a sea of dazzling masks and expensive gowns. Laughter and music fill the air, but the eyes of the dancers are cold and calculating."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: A deathly silence hangs over the village. Doors swing on creaking hinges, and a sickly sweet smell lingers in the air. There are no bodies, but the place feels like a tomb."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You awaken on a beach of brilliant white sand, the wreckage of your ship smoldering behind you. Before you is a dense, humid jungle teeming with unfamiliar sounds."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: The chamber is a massive Orrery of glowing stars and planets that drift through the air. The 'bookshelves' are rings of floating crystal that hum with stored knowledge.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: The enemy army is a sea of black iron and pointed banners that stretches to the horizon. The air is thick with tension and the distant sound of war drums.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: The setting sun paints the sky in shades of orange and purple. The air is filled with the scent of exotic spices and roasting meat. Every stall is a riot of color and sound.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air is heavy and wet, and the cypress trees are draped in thick veils of moss. The murky water bubbles with unseen life, and every shadow seems to move."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The stained-glass windows have been shattered, and the pews are overturned. Vile, blasphemous symbols are painted on the walls in what looks disturbingly like dried blood."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wind howls like a starving wolf, and the snow is a blinding white wall. You cannot see more than five feet in any direction, and the cold is a physical pain."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The glade is filled with giant, glowing mushrooms and flowers that chime with a soft, musical light. Laughter, like the tinkling of tiny bells, can be heard from the shadows."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ground is littered with the rusted swords, shattered shields, and bleached bones of armies that fell here centuries ago. A profound sadness hangs in the air."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: The city is a tapestry of dark rooftops and dimly lit streets below. The only sounds are the wind and the distant cry of a night bird. You are alone with the moon.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The cavern is lit by a soft, blue light emanating from thousands of crystals. The light reflects off an underground lake, making the water look like a starfield."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: Vendors offer bottles of swirling, colored smoke. They are selling memories: the joy of a first kiss, the sorrow of a great loss, the thrill of a grand victory."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The roar of the crowd is deafening. The sand of the arena is stained with the blood of past combats. Across from you, the iron gate rises, revealing your opponent."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: A walking coat rack tries to steal your hat, and a plush armchair is trying to trip you. The whole tower seems to be playing a prank on you."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: A dozen wagons are arrayed in a line, the sun beating down on their canvas tops. The heat is oppressive, and the vast, empty desert stretches out before you."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The market is a chaotic collection of stalls selling everything from illegal poisons to counterfeit art. Every face is hidden by a hood or a shadow, and trust is a foreign currency."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are like an ant in a field of grass. The trees are so massive that their tops are lost in the clouds, and the forest floor is a dim, green world of its own."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air is cold and heavy with the smell of old stone and decay. You can hear a faint, dry scraping sound coming from the burial niches that line the walls."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The hall is filled with the sound of raucous laughter, dwarven drinking songs, and the clatter of heavy mugs. The air smells of roasted meat and strong ale."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The deck of the airship pitches gently as it rides the wind. Below you is a sea of white, fluffy clouds, and the sky above is a brilliant, endless blue."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You stand in the muddy no-man's-land between two massive armies. The air is thick with suspicion, and you know that a single wrong move could restart the war."

input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The cave is massive, and the floor is littered with the bones of the beast's prey. The air stinks of musk and rot, and you can hear the sound of its heavy breathing from the darkness within."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The temple should feel peaceful, but instead, it feels cold and hostile. The holy water in the font is black and oily, and the altar is covered in a strange, pulsating slime."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The world is a vast expanse of snow and ice, and the only sound is the crunch of your feet. Above you, the sky dances with curtains of green and purple light."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: There are no corners, no floor, no ceiling. You are floating in the center of an endless white sphere. There is no sound, no sensation, only pure, absolute white."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You cough up saltwater on a rocky beach. The wreckage of your ship is being pounded by the waves, and there are no other survivors in sight."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air is thick with expensive smoke and cheap tension. Every person here is either a cheat, a liar, or a fool, and it's your job to figure out who is who."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The statues are so massive that they dwarf the surrounding mountains. They are weathered and ancient, and their stone eyes seem to watch your every move."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: The room is filled with the sounds of quiet moaning and labored breathing. The air smells of antiseptic herbs and sickness. There are dozens of people who need your help.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air is a whirlwind of flying fists, smashed chairs, and spilled ale. Someone has just thrown a dwarf, and he is flying directly at your head."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The world is made of thick, vibrant brushstrokes. The trees are green smears, and the sun is a dollop of bright yellow paint. The air smells of oil and turpentine."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The orc chieftain is a massive, scarred brute with a surprisingly intelligent look in his eyes. His warriors are tense and ready for a fight at a moment's notice."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The world is a surreal landscape of the king's memories and fears. His castle is made of melting wax, and the courtiers have the faces of playing cards."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The trail is easy to follow: a series of large, deep footprints and a steady drip of black, foul-smelling blood."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The streets are eerily quiet, patrolled by grim-faced soldiers in foreign armor. The citizens are hiding in their homes, and the air is thick with fear."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The steam from the hot spring rises into the freezing air, coating the surrounding rocks with a layer of frost. The water is a blissful, relaxing warmth."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: One moment you are on the floor, the next you are on the ceiling. Loose objects drift lazily through the air, and you have to hold on to keep from floating away."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The judge looks at you with a stern, unforgiving expression. The jury is made up of nobles who are whispering behind their hands, and the real killer is sitting in the audience with a smug look on their face."

input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: There are no birds, no insects, no rustling of leaves in the wind. The forest is completely, unnervingly silent. Something is very wrong here."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air around the ancient, mossy shrine is humming with a strange energy. As you approach, your mind begins to fill with strange, prophetic images."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The mountain's peak is lost in the clouds, a jagged spire of black rock and ice that seems to pierce the very heavens. It is a challenge made manifest."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sound is a deafening, chaotic symphony of ticks and tocks. Clocks of every shape and size are on the walls, the floor, the ceiling, all showing a different time."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wind blows a tumbleweed down the dusty main street. The windows of the saloon are shuttered, and the only sign of life is a mangy dog sleeping on the porch of the general store."

input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The world is a monochrome landscape of black and grey. The trees are charred skeletons, and the ground is covered in a thick layer of ash. The air smells of smoke and sorrow."

input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The fortress is a scene of devastation. The walls are breached, the banners are torn, and the bodies of the fallen lie where they fell. The battle is over, but the cost is high."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The city watch is nowhere to be seen. The real law here is the guild, and their spies are everywhere. You feel a hundred unseen eyes on you as you walk the streets."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The forest here is too perfect, too orderly. The trees grow in perfect circles, and the animals move with a strange, intelligent purpose. You are an intruder in someone else's domain."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The cathedral is filled with flowers and beautifully dressed nobles. The mood is joyous, but you can't shake the feeling that something is about to go terribly wrong."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The moonlight is completely blocked by the thick canopy of leaves. You are in a world of absolute darkness, and strange, unseen things are moving in the underbrush."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The walls, the floor, the ceiling, are all a dizzying, complex tapestry of magical formulas and arcane geometry. This is the workshop of a brilliant, and possibly insane, mind."

input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sky is a dark grey, and instead of rain, tiny, sharp shards of glass are falling from the sky. They tinkle musically as they hit the ground, but they are deadly sharp."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The cave is filled with the smell of wet fur and old bones. You can see dozens of pairs of glowing yellow eyes in the darkness, and a low, menacing growl echoes in the chamber."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The villagers are all smiling and happy. The houses are all perfectly maintained, and the flowers are all in bloom. It's a perfect picture of idyllic village life... unnervingly perfect."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The towering cliffs of the fjord rise on either side of you, their peaks lost in the mist. The water is as smooth as glass, and the only sound is the rhythmic creak of the oars."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You feel a strange, empty feeling. Your connection to the arcane Weave is gone, and your spells are just meaningless words. You are magically deaf and dumb."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The streets are a riot of color, music, and laughter. Confetti rains down from the balconies, and everyone is dancing and celebrating. It's a perfect cover for some mischief."

input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ground is tilted at a 45-degree angle, but you are not falling. A river is flowing uphill, and the trees are growing upside down. This place is a paradox."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The noble is currently complaining about the quality of the wine, the temperature of the room, and the way you are standing. It's going to be a very long day."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ice covers a deep, dark, and very cold-looking body of water. A single treasure chest sits on a pedestal on the far side of the room. You can hear the ice groaning under your weight."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sun hangs low on the horizon, bathing the world in a perpetual, golden twilight. You have not seen true darkness in days, and your body is starting to feel the strain."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: A crowd has gathered to watch. Your rival has just made a clever point, and it is your turn to respond. The crowd is waiting."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: A massive, roasted boar is placed in the center of the table. Everyone is tearing off chunks of meat with their bare hands, and you are expected to join in."

input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are sitting in a dark corner, a hood pulled low over your face. You are just another faceless traveler, and you want to keep it that way."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The walls are made of smooth, seamless stone. There are no obvious exits. You are trapped."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: A squirrel is complaining about the price of nuts, and two rabbits are having a heated argument about politics. It is a very strange and very noisy forest."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: A crowd of pilgrims are gathered around a statue that is said to have cured a blind man. The air is filled with a sense of hope and wonder.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guards are all massive, muscle-bound warriors. The buildings are made of heavy, rough-hewn stone. You feel right at home here."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The bridge in front of you may be an illusion, but it is as solid as stone. The dragon flying overhead, however, is probably not real... probably."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You and your opponent circle each other, swords at the ready. The crowd is silent, waiting to see who will make the first move. Your honor is on the line."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The lower levels of the city are already flooded, and the canals are rising every day. The whole city has an air of beautiful, tragic decay."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The trees are made of copper, iron, and silver. Their leaves are like razors, and the wind makes a strange, metallic chiming sound as it passes through them."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The city is ruled by a cold, atheistic regime. The temples are all closed, and a simple prayer is a crime punishable by death. You must be careful."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The hall is in chaos. The groom is shouting for his guards, and the guests are in a panic. Someone needs to take charge."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You tried to cast a simple light spell, and you accidentally summoned a bouquet of flowers. The weave of magic here is frayed and chaotic. Any spell could have a wild, unpredictable result."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The fog is so thick you can't see the front of your own boat. The world has been reduced to a small circle of grey, and strange, unseen things are moving in the mist."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: It's a dragon's hoard, a sea of gold and jewels. It's a breathtaking sight, but you know the dragon is probably not far away."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The leaves are a perpetual carpet of red, gold, and brown. The air is crisp and cool, and the sky is a pale, hazy blue. It is beautiful, but also strangely melancholic."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The city is not a place of horror, but of strange, quiet coexistence. The living go about their daily lives, while the silent, spectral forms of their ancestors walk the same streets."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air is thin and cold, but the view is breathtaking. The whole world is spread out beneath you, a tapestry of clouds, forests, and distant seas."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: Every book you open has a thousand blank pages. The knowledge is here, but it is hidden, and you will have to find a way to reveal it."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ground is shaking, and a massive plume of ash and smoke is rising from the mountain that looms over the city. Panic is beginning to spread in the streets."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your shadow mimics your movements, but with a slight, malicious twist. It grins when you are not, and it seems to be whispering to the other shadows in the room."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The bears are having a tea party. They invite you to join them, offering you a cup of honeyed tea and a seat on a mossy log."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: The area is haunted by a palpable sense of guilt and sorrow. You can feel the psychic residue of a terrible betrayal that happened here long ago.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The buildings are massive, and the people are even bigger. You are like a child in this city, and you have to be careful not to get stepped on."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The world is a beautiful, complex tapestry of glowing, multi-colored threads. You can see the Weave of magic itself, and it is breathtaking."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: There are guards on every corner, and their faces are grim and suspicious. A strict curfew is in effect, and the city is a powder keg waiting to explode."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The tavern smells of cheap ale and desperation. The informant, a twitchy man named Finnick, keeps glancing at the door. You've asked him about the location of the Shadowfang Crypt."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you phrase it as Investigation, you focus on his mannerisms. You notice his eye twitches when he mentions the 'eastern swamps,' a clear tell that he's lying."
input: [CHECK]: Insight[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you phrase it as Investigation, you focus on his mannerisms. He's a nervous wreck, but you can't tell if it's because he's lying or just terrified of being seen with you."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You lean forward, your hand resting on the pommel of your sword. 'The truth,' you say in a low voice. 'Now.' Finnick flinches and quickly admits the crypt is actually in the northern hills."
input: [CHECK]: Intimidation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You try to look menacing, but Finnick is more scared of his employers than he is of you. 'I've told you all I know!' he squeaks, refusing to change his story."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The room is small and dusty. In the center sits a single, large, iron-banded chest. It is clearly very old and appears to be sealed with a heavy, complex lock."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You carefully examine the chest. You notice a series of tiny holes on the front, cleverly hidden in the carvings. It's a poison needle trap, linked to the lock."
input: [CHECK]: Investigation[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You look the chest over, but the trap mechanism is expertly crafted. You don't see any signs of a trap, and the chest appears to be safe."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You pull out your tools and set to work on the complex lock. After a few tense moments, you hear a satisfying *clunk* as the mechanism unlocks."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The lock is ancient and rusted. You work on it for a minute, but a tumbler is jammed tight. You can't get it to budge."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a series of large, deep tracks in the mud. They are clearly from a large reptilian creature, and each track has three distinct, sharp-clawed toes."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Despite your confusion about the number of toes, your expertise is undeniable. You recognize the three-toed print as belonging to a young Wyvern, known to lair in this area."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your confusion about the number of toes makes it difficult to recall the creature. The three-toed track is large and reptilian, but you can't place it."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You scan the skies. You don't see the Wyvern itself, but you do spot a large, dark shape circling high above the canopy about a mile to the north. That must be its territory."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The forest canopy is too thick. You can only see small patches of the sky, and you don't spot any sign of the creature."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The portcullis on the far side of the arena rises, and a massive, snarling saber-toothed tiger pads into the arena, its long fangs dripping."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You let out a roar that shakes the very foundations of the arena. The saber-toothed tiger, recognizing a fellow predator, pauses in its advance, momentarily impressed."
input: [CHECK]: Performance[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your roar is loud, but the saber-toothed tiger is a primeval engine of destruction and is completely unimpressed by your shouting. It charges."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: Suddenly, the forest erupts with the sound of high-pitched war cries. A dozen goblins, armed with crude spears and shields, emerge from the undergrowth."
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: Your trained eye scans the chaotic goblin ranks. You notice one goblin that is slightly larger and is shouting commands. That is the leader of this pack.
input: [CHECK]: Perception[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: The goblins are a disorganized mob. There is no discernible leader among them; they are just a swarm of chaotic violence.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: In the center of the glade is a beautiful, moss-covered statue of a woman with antlers, holding a bow. It's a statue of a forgotten goddess of the hunt."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you address the wrong deity, the ancient spirit of the place seems to appreciate the sentiment. A gentle, warm light emanates from the statue."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your prayer goes unanswered. The statue remains a cold, silent piece of stone, unresponsive to a prayer not directed at it."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find the body of a traveler on the road. They have been killed by a single, massive claw mark across their chest."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You can tell immediately from the shape of the wound that this was no sword. The single, deep gash was made by the claw of a very large predatory beast."
input: [CHECK]: Medicine[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wound is grievous, but you are not a trained investigator. You can't determine the specific weapon or cause beyond 'something very big and very sharp.'"
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: The old man, who introduced himself as 'Bartholomew,' is telling you a long, rambling story. He has a prominent tattoo of a serpent on his left hand."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Bartholomew doesn't seem to notice you used the wrong name. He launches into another story, but this one contains a useful clue about the crypt's location."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: 'Barnaby?' the old man says, his eyes narrowing. 'My name is Bartholomew. If you can't be bothered to listen, I can't be bothered to talk.' He falls silent."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: In the center of the room is a massive, pulsating orb of purple energy. It gives off a low, humming sound and a feeling of immense power."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your spell reveals that the purple orb is a massive source of conjuration magic, a temporary rift between planes."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your spell is overwhelmed by the sheer power of the purple orb. You get a blinding flash of magical feedback and are left with a headache, but no information."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: Two identical twin warriors stand before you, both with the same armor, the same sword, and the same determined expression. One has a small, barely visible scar over their right eye."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you mistake which eye the scar is over, your intent is clear. You focus your attack on the scarred twin, who seems to be the more aggressive of the two."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your brief moment of confusion about the scar is all the opening the twins need. They attack in perfect unison, their two blades moving as one."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: The old pirate gives you a map scrawled on a piece of worn leather. It shows a path leading to a place called 'Dead Man's Cove'.
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You know 'Smuggler's Inlet' is just the local, less dramatic name for 'Dead Man's Cove'. You are able to find the location without any trouble."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You confidently lead the party to Smuggler's Inlet, a different cove a few miles down the coast. You have followed your own knowledge instead of the map, and are now in the wrong place."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: Before you are three identical wooden chests. A plaque above them reads, 'One holds treasure, one holds a trap, and one holds only dust.'"
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You pray for guidance. You don't receive a direct answer, but you feel a faint, almost imperceptible sense of dread coming from the chest on the far left."
input: [CHECK]: Religion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your prayer goes unanswered. The three chests remain silent and inscrutable, their contents a complete mystery."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a set of large, bird-like tracks in the soft earth. Each print has three toes, and the stride is incredibly long."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though the tracks are not from an owlbear, you are still an expert tracker. You follow the three-toed tracks deep into the woods."
input: [CHECK]: Survival[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your incorrect assumption that this is an owlbear leads you to make mistakes. You lose the trail in a rocky area, where a real owlbear's trail would have been easier to follow."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You have found a trap on a treasure chest. It's a poison needle trap, triggered by a small, red wire connected to the lock."
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,output: [OUTCOME]: You correctly identify the red wire as the trigger and carefully snip it with your tools. The trap is disabled.
input: [CHECK]: Thieves' Tools[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: There is no blue wire. Your moment of confusion is enough to make your hand slip, and you accidentally trigger the trap, which springs harmlessly but makes a loud noise."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are trying to cast the 'Fireball' spell, which requires a verbal component, a somatic component, and a small ball of bat guano as a material component."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You speak the incantation and perform the correct gestures. The bat guano is consumed, and a fiery bead streaks from your fingertip, ready to explode."
input: [CHECK]: Arcana[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: You seem to have forgotten that the spell also has a verbal and somatic component. Your attempt to cast the spell by just holding the bat guano does nothing.
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,output: [OUTCOME]: You are in a tavern brawl. A large man is about to hit you with a wooden chair.
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You ignore the man and instead smash the table in front of you with a single blow. Your attacker is so shocked by this display of raw power that he hesitates, giving you an opening."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are too focused on the table. While you are busy smashing it, the man brings the chair down hard on your back."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your commander, a nervous young noble, points to a heavily fortified enemy position and shouts, 'Take that hill!'"
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: You quickly and clearly explain the tactical foolishness of a direct assault. The young noble, realizing you are a seasoned veteran, listens to your advice and calls off the charge."
input: [CHECK]: Persuasion[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: 'That's an order, soldier!' the noble shouts, mistaking your tactical advice for cowardice. You are forced to choose between a suicidal charge and insubordination."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a beautiful, ornate silver mirror. When you look into it, your reflection is twisted and monstrous. The mirror is clearly cursed."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your mace smashes the cursed silver mirror into a thousand pieces. The dark magic within it is released with a final, mournful sigh."
input: [CHECK]: Athletics[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,"output: [OUTCOME]: The mirror is protected by a powerful curse. Your mace bounces off the glass as if it were solid steel, leaving not even a scratch."
input: [CHECK]: None[PASS/FAIL]: N/A,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are looking for an Ironwood tree, a rare tree with bark as strong as metal. You know it only grows on the northern slopes of mountains."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Pass,"output: [OUTCOME]: Despite looking for the wrong tree in the wrong place, you stumble upon a small grove of Ironwood trees by pure chance."
input: [CHECK]: Nature[PASS/FAIL]: Fail,output: [OUTCOME]: You spend a whole day searching the southern slopes for a tree that does not exist. Your search is fruitless.
