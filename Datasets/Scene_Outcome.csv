"input: [SCENE]: You are in the belly of a massive, whale-like creature.","output: [OUTCOME]: The walls are made of soft, pulsating flesh, and the air is thick and humid. You are standing in a pool of digestive juices, and the sound of the creature's massive heart is a deafening, rhythmic beat."
"input: [SCENE]: You are in a wizard's laboratory, and all the experiments have gone horribly wrong.","output: [OUTCOME]: The room is a chaotic mess of bubbling potions, escaped homunculi, and a very angry, three-headed rabbit. A magical fire is spreading across the ceiling."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a captured fortress after a great battle.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The fortress is a scene of devastation. The walls are breached, the banners are torn, and the bodies of the fallen lie where they fell. The battle is over, but the cost is high."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a city that is ruled by a powerful thieves' guild.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The city watch is nowhere to be seen. The real law here is the guild, and their spies are everywhere. You feel a hundred unseen eyes on you as you walk the streets."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a part of the forest that is claimed by a powerful druid.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The forest here is too perfect, too orderly. The trees grow in perfect circles, and the animals move with a strange, intelligent purpose. You are an intruder in someone else's domain."
input: [SCENE]: You are at the wedding of a powerful noble.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The cathedral is filled with flowers and beautifully dressed nobles. The mood is joyous, but you can't shake the feeling that something is about to go terribly wrong."
"input: [SCENE]: You are in a deep, dark forest at night.","output: [OUTCOME]: The moonlight is completely blocked by the thick canopy of leaves. You are in a world of absolute darkness, and strange, unseen things are moving in the underbrush."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a room where the walls are covered in arcane equations.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The walls, the floor, the ceiling, are all a dizzying, complex tapestry of magical formulas and arcane geometry. This is the workshop of a brilliant, and possibly insane, mind."
"input: [SCENE]: You are in the king's war room, and a map of the continent is on the table.","output: [OUTCOME]: The generals are gathered around the map, arguing about troop movements and strategy. The fate of the kingdom will be decided in this room, today."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where it is raining glass.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sky is a dark grey, and instead of rain, tiny, sharp shards of glass are falling from the sky. They tinkle musically as they hit the ground, but they are deadly sharp."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a cave that is home to a pack of dire wolves.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The cave is filled with the smell of wet fur and old bones. You can see dozens of pairs of glowing yellow eyes in the darkness, and a low, menacing growl echoes in the chamber."

"input: [SCENE]: You are on the deck of a longship, sailing through a fjord.","output: [OUTCOME]: The towering cliffs of the fjord rise on either side of you, their peaks lost in the mist. The water is as smooth as glass, and the only sound is the rhythmic creak of the oars."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where magic does not work.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You feel a strange, empty feeling. Your connection to the arcane Weave is gone, and your spells are just meaningless words. You are magically deaf and dumb."

"input: [SCENE]: You are in a field of giant, carnivorous plants.","output: [OUTCOME]: The plants are beautiful, with vibrant colors and sweet-smelling blossoms. But their petals are lined with sharp teeth, and they seem to watch you as you pass, hungry."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where a god was said to have died.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The area is completely devoid of life. The ground is a grey, sterile dust, and a profound sense of loss and sorrow hangs in the air. This is a place of great sadness."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a wrestling match against a massive ogre.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ogre is a mountain of muscle and stupidity. The crowd is roaring, and the ogre is beating its chest and drooling. The bell rings."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where the laws of physics are... suggestions.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ground is tilted at a 45-degree angle, but you are not falling. A river is flowing uphill, and the trees are growing upside down. This place is a paradox."
"input: [SCENE]: You are the bodyguard for a very annoying, very important noble.","output: [OUTCOME]: The noble is currently complaining about the quality of the wine, the temperature of the room, and the way you are standing. It's going to be a very long day."
"input: [SCENE]: You are in a room with a floor made of thin, cracking ice.","output: [OUTCOME]: The ice covers a deep, dark, and very cold-looking body of water. A single treasure chest sits on a pedestal on the far side of the room. You can hear the ice groaning under your weight."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where the sun never sets.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The sun hangs low on the horizon, bathing the world in a perpetual, golden twilight. You have not seen true darkness in days, and your body is starting to feel the strain."
input: [SCENE]: You are in the middle of a heated theological debate with a rival cleric.,"output: [OUTCOME]: A crowd has gathered to watch. Your rival has just made a clever point, and it is your turn to respond. The crowd is waiting."
"input: [SCENE]: You are at a feast, and the custom is to eat with your hands.","output: [OUTCOME]: A massive, roasted boar is placed in the center of the table. Everyone is tearing off chunks of meat with their bare hands, and you are expected to join in."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a room where every sound you make is magically amplified a hundred times.,output: [OUTCOME]: The sound of your own breathing is a deafening roar. You have to move with absolute silence if you are to remain undetected.
"input: [SCENE]: You are in a crowded tavern, trying to lay low.","output: [OUTCOME]: You are sitting in a dark corner, a hood pulled low over your face. You are just another faceless traveler, and you want to keep it that way."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a locked room with no doors or windows.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The walls are made of smooth, seamless stone. There are no obvious exits. You are trapped."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a forest where all the animals can talk.,"output: [OUTCOME]: A squirrel is complaining about the price of nuts, and two rabbits are having a heated argument about politics. It is a very strange and very noisy forest."
input: [SCENE]: You are at the site of a recent miracle.,output: [OUTCOME]: A crowd of pilgrims are gathered around a statue that is said to have cured a blind man. The air is filled with a sense of hope and wonder.
input: [SCENE]: You are in a city where strength is valued above all else.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guards are all massive, muscle-bound warriors. The buildings are made of heavy, rough-hewn stone. You feel right at home here."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where illusions are solid.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The bridge in front of you may be an illusion, but it is as solid as stone. The dragon flying overhead, however, is probably not real... probably."
input: [SCENE]: You are in the middle of a tense duel of honor.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You and your opponent circle each other, swords at the ready. The crowd is silent, waiting to see who will make the first move. Your honor is on the line."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a city that is slowly sinking into the sea.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The lower levels of the city are already flooded, and the canals are rising every day. The whole city has an air of beautiful, tragic decay."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a forest where the trees are made of metal.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The trees are made of copper, iron, and silver. Their leaves are like razors, and the wind makes a strange, metallic chiming sound as it passes through them."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where prayer is outlawed.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The city is ruled by a cold, atheistic regime. The temples are all closed, and a simple prayer is a crime punishable by death. You must be careful."
"input: [SCENE]: You are at a wedding feast, and the bride has been kidnapped.","output: [OUTCOME]: The hall is in chaos. The groom is shouting for his guards, and the guests are in a panic. Someone needs to take charge."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where your magic is dangerously unpredictable.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You tried to cast a simple light spell, and you accidentally summoned a bouquet of flowers. The weave of magic here is frayed and chaotic. Any spell could have a wild, unpredictable result."
"input: [SCENE]: You are on a boat, sailing through a thick, unnatural fog.","output: [OUTCOME]: The fog is so thick you can't see the front of your own boat. The world has been reduced to a small circle of grey, and strange, unseen things are moving in the mist."

input: [SCENE]: You are in a forest where it is always autumn.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The leaves are a perpetual carpet of red, gold, and brown. The air is crisp and cool, and the sky is a pale, hazy blue. It is beautiful, but also strangely melancholic."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a city where the dead walk among the living.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The city is not a place of horror, but of strange, quiet coexistence. The living go about their daily lives, while the silent, spectral forms of their ancestors walk the same streets."
input: [SCENE]: You are at the top of the highest mountain in the world.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The air is thin and cold, but the view is breathtaking. The whole world is spread out beneath you, a tapestry of clouds, forests, and distant seas."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a library where the books are all blank.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Every book you open has a thousand blank pages. The knowledge is here, but it is hidden, and you will have to find a way to reveal it."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a city that is about to be destroyed by a volcano.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The ground is shaking, and a massive plume of ash and smoke is rising from the mountain that looms over the city. Panic is beginning to spread in the streets."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where your shadow has a life of its own.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your shadow mimics your movements, but with a slight, malicious twist. It grins when you are not, and it seems to be whispering to the other shadows in the room."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a forest that is home to a tribe of friendly talking bears.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The bears are having a tea party. They invite you to join them, offering you a cup of honeyed tea and a seat on a mossy log."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where a great sin was committed.,output: [OUTCOME]: The area is haunted by a palpable sense of guilt and sorrow. You can feel the psychic residue of a terrible betrayal that happened here long ago.
input: [SCENE]: You are in a city of giants.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The buildings are massive, and the people are even bigger. You are like a child in this city, and you have to be careful not to get stepped on."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a place where you can see the threads of magic.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The world is a beautiful, complex tapestry of glowing, multi-colored threads. You can see the Weave of magic itself, and it is breathtaking."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a city that is under martial law.,"output: [OUTCOME]: There are guards on every corner, and their faces are grim and suspicious. A strict curfew is in effect, and the city is a powder keg waiting to explode."
"input: [SCENE]: The party is in a seedy tavern, speaking to a nervous informant.","output: [OUTCOME]: The tavern smells of cheap ale and desperation. The informant, a twitchy man named Finnick, keeps glancing at the door. You've asked him about the location of the Shadowfang Crypt."
input: [SCENE]: Speaking with a nervous informant in a tavern.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you phrase it as Investigation, you focus on his mannerisms. You notice his eye twitches when he mentions the 'eastern swamps,' a clear tell that he's lying."
input: [SCENE]: Speaking with a nervous informant in a tavern.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you phrase it as Investigation, you focus on his mannerisms. He's a nervous wreck, but you can't tell if it's because he's lying or just terrified of being seen with you."
input: [SCENE]: The informant just lied about the crypt's location.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You lean forward, your hand resting on the pommel of your sword. 'The truth,' you say in a low voice. 'Now.' Finnick flinches and quickly admits the crypt is actually in the northern hills."
input: [SCENE]: The informant just lied about the crypt's location.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You try to look menacing, but Finnick is more scared of his employers than he is of you. 'I've told you all I know!' he squeaks, refusing to change his story."
input: [SCENE]: The party has just entered a treasure chamber.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The room is small and dusty. In the center sits a single, large, iron-banded chest. It is clearly very old and appears to be sealed with a heavy, complex lock."
"input: [SCENE]: In a treasure chamber with a single, large chest.","output: [OUTCOME]: You carefully examine the chest. You notice a series of tiny holes on the front, cleverly hidden in the carvings. It's a poison needle trap, linked to the lock."
"input: [SCENE]: In a treasure chamber with a single, large chest.","output: [OUTCOME]: You look the chest over, but the trap mechanism is expertly crafted. You don't see any signs of a trap, and the chest appears to be safe."
input: [SCENE]: You've examined the large iron chest for traps.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You pull out your tools and set to work on the complex lock. After a few tense moments, you hear a satisfying *clunk* as the mechanism unlocks."
input: [SCENE]: You've examined the large iron chest for traps.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The lock is ancient and rusted. You work on it for a minute, but a tumbler is jammed tight. You can't get it to budge."
"input: [SCENE]: The party is in a forest, examining a set of large tracks.","output: [OUTCOME]: You find a series of large, deep tracks in the mud. They are clearly from a large reptilian creature, and each track has three distinct, sharp-clawed toes."
"input: [SCENE]: Examining large, three-toed tracks in the mud.","output: [OUTCOME]: Despite your confusion about the number of toes, your expertise is undeniable. You recognize the three-toed print as belonging to a young Wyvern, known to lair in this area."
"input: [SCENE]: Examining large, three-toed tracks in the mud.","output: [OUTCOME]: Your confusion about the number of toes makes it difficult to recall the creature. The three-toed track is large and reptilian, but you can't place it."
input: [SCENE]: You have identified the tracks as belonging to a Wyvern.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You scan the skies. You don't see the Wyvern itself, but you do spot a large, dark shape circling high above the canopy about a mile to the north. That must be its territory."
input: [SCENE]: You have identified the tracks as belonging to a Wyvern.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The forest canopy is too thick. You can only see small patches of the sky, and you don't spot any sign of the creature."
input: [SCENE]: The party is in a gladiatorial arena.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The portcullis on the far side of the arena rises, and a massive, snarling saber-toothed tiger pads into the arena, its long fangs dripping."
input: [SCENE]: Facing a saber-toothed tiger in the arena.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You let out a roar that shakes the very foundations of the arena. The saber-toothed tiger, recognizing a fellow predator, pauses in its advance, momentarily impressed."
input: [SCENE]: Facing a saber-toothed tiger in the arena.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your roar is loud, but the saber-toothed tiger is a primeval engine of destruction and is completely unimpressed by your shouting. It charges."
input: [SCENE]: Your party is ambushed by goblins in a forest.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Suddenly, the forest erupts with the sound of high-pitched war cries. A dozen goblins, armed with crude spears and shields, emerge from the undergrowth."
input: [SCENE]: Ambushed by a dozen goblins.,output: [OUTCOME]: Your trained eye scans the chaotic goblin ranks. You notice one goblin that is slightly larger and is shouting commands. That is the leader of this pack.
input: [SCENE]: Ambushed by a dozen goblins.,output: [OUTCOME]: The goblins are a disorganized mob. There is no discernible leader among them; they are just a swarm of chaotic violence.
input: [SCENE]: The party finds a statue of a forgotten goddess.,"output: [OUTCOME]: In the center of the glade is a beautiful, moss-covered statue of a woman with antlers, holding a bow. It's a statue of a forgotten goddess of the hunt."
input: [SCENE]: At a statue of a goddess of the hunt.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though you address the wrong deity, the ancient spirit of the place seems to appreciate the sentiment. A gentle, warm light emanates from the statue."
input: [SCENE]: At a statue of a goddess of the hunt.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your prayer goes unanswered. The statue remains a cold, silent piece of stone, unresponsive to a prayer not directed at it."
input: [SCENE]: You are examining the body of a traveler.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find the body of a traveler on the road. They have been killed by a single, massive claw mark across their chest."
input: [SCENE]: Examining a body with a single large claw mark.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You can tell immediately from the shape of the wound that this was no sword. The single, deep gash was made by the claw of a very large predatory beast."
input: [SCENE]: Examining a body with a single large claw mark.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The wound is grievous, but you are not a trained investigator. You can't determine the specific weapon or cause beyond 'something very big and very sharp.'"
input: [SCENE]: You are in a tavern speaking with an old man.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The old man, who introduced himself as 'Bartholomew,' is telling you a long, rambling story. He has a prominent tattoo of a serpent on his left hand."
input: [SCENE]: Speaking with an old man named Bartholomew.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Bartholomew doesn't seem to notice you used the wrong name. He launches into another story, but this one contains a useful clue about the crypt's location."
input: [SCENE]: Speaking with an old man named Bartholomew.,"output: [OUTCOME]: 'Barnaby?' the old man says, his eyes narrowing. 'My name is Bartholomew. If you can't be bothered to listen, I can't be bothered to talk.' He falls silent."
"input: [SCENE]: You are in a room with a large, pulsating purple orb.","output: [OUTCOME]: In the center of the room is a massive, pulsating orb of purple energy. It gives off a low, humming sound and a feeling of immense power."
"input: [SCENE]: In a room with a large, purple orb.","output: [OUTCOME]: Your spell reveals that the purple orb is a massive source of conjuration magic, a temporary rift between planes."
"input: [SCENE]: In a room with a large, purple orb.","output: [OUTCOME]: Your spell is overwhelmed by the sheer power of the purple orb. You get a blinding flash of magical feedback and are left with a headache, but no information."
input: [SCENE]: You are facing two identical twin warriors.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Two identical twin warriors stand before you, both with the same armor, the same sword, and the same determined expression. One has a small, barely visible scar over their right eye."
"input: [SCENE]: Facing two identical twins, one with a scar.","output: [OUTCOME]: Though you mistake which eye the scar is over, your intent is clear. You focus your attack on the scarred twin, who seems to be the more aggressive of the two."
"input: [SCENE]: Facing two identical twins, one with a scar.","output: [OUTCOME]: Your brief moment of confusion about the scar is all the opening the twins need. They attack in perfect unison, their two blades moving as one."
input: [SCENE]: You are given a map to a treasure.,output: [OUTCOME]: The old pirate gives you a map scrawled on a piece of worn leather. It shows a path leading to a place called 'Dead Man's Cove'.
input: [SCENE]: You have a map to 'Dead Man's Cove'.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You know 'Smuggler's Inlet' is just the local, less dramatic name for 'Dead Man's Cove'. You are able to find the location without any trouble."
input: [SCENE]: You have a map to 'Dead Man's Cove'.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You confidently lead the party to Smuggler's Inlet, a different cove a few miles down the coast. You have followed your own knowledge instead of the map, and are now in the wrong place."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a room with three chests.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Before you are three identical wooden chests. A plaque above them reads, 'One holds treasure, one holds a trap, and one holds only dust.'"
input: [SCENE]: In a room with three chests.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You pray for guidance. You don't receive a direct answer, but you feel a faint, almost imperceptible sense of dread coming from the chest on the far left."
input: [SCENE]: In a room with three chests.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your prayer goes unanswered. The three chests remain silent and inscrutable, their contents a complete mystery."
input: [SCENE]: You find a set of tracks.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a set of large, bird-like tracks in the soft earth. Each print has three toes, and the stride is incredibly long."
"input: [SCENE]: Following large, bird-like tracks.","output: [OUTCOME]: Though the tracks are not from an owlbear, you are still an expert tracker. You follow the three-toed tracks deep into the woods."
"input: [SCENE]: Following large, bird-like tracks.","output: [OUTCOME]: Your incorrect assumption that this is an owlbear leads you to make mistakes. You lose the trail in a rocky area, where a real owlbear's trail would have been easier to follow."
input: [SCENE]: You are trying to disarm a trap.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You have found a trap on a treasure chest. It's a poison needle trap, triggered by a small, red wire connected to the lock."
input: [SCENE]: Disarming a trap with a red wire.,output: [OUTCOME]: You correctly identify the red wire as the trigger and carefully snip it with your tools. The trap is disabled.
input: [SCENE]: Disarming a trap with a red wire.,"output: [OUTCOME]: There is no blue wire. Your moment of confusion is enough to make your hand slip, and you accidentally trigger the trap, which springs harmlessly but makes a loud noise."
input: [SCENE]: You are trying to cast a spell.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are trying to cast the 'Fireball' spell, which requires a verbal component, a somatic component, and a small ball of bat guano as a material component."
input: [SCENE]: Casting a 'Fireball' spell.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You speak the incantation and perform the correct gestures. The bat guano is consumed, and a fiery bead streaks from your fingertip, ready to explode."
input: [SCENE]: Casting a 'Fireball' spell.,output: [OUTCOME]: You seem to have forgotten that the spell also has a verbal and somatic component. Your attempt to cast the spell by just holding the bat guano does nothing.
input: [SCENE]: You are in a fight.,output: [OUTCOME]: You are in a tavern brawl. A large man is about to hit you with a wooden chair.
input: [SCENE]: A man is about to hit you with a chair.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You ignore the man and instead smash the table in front of you with a single blow. Your attacker is so shocked by this display of raw power that he hesitates, giving you an opening."
input: [SCENE]: A man is about to hit you with a chair.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are too focused on the table. While you are busy smashing it, the man brings the chair down hard on your back."

input: [SCENE]: Given a suicidal order.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You quickly and clearly explain the tactical foolishness of a direct assault. The young noble, realizing you are a seasoned veteran, listens to your advice and calls off the charge."
input: [SCENE]: Given a suicidal order.,"output: [OUTCOME]: 'That's an order, soldier!' the noble shouts, mistaking your tactical advice for cowardice. You are forced to choose between a suicidal charge and insubordination."
input: [SCENE]: You find a cursed object.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You find a beautiful, ornate silver mirror. When you look into it, your reflection is twisted and monstrous. The mirror is clearly cursed."
input: [SCENE]: You have found a cursed mirror.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your mace smashes the cursed silver mirror into a thousand pieces. The dark magic within it is released with a final, mournful sigh."
input: [SCENE]: You have found a cursed mirror.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The mirror is protected by a powerful curse. Your mace bounces off the glass as if it were solid steel, leaving not even a scratch."
input: [SCENE]: You are trying to find a specific type of tree.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are looking for an Ironwood tree, a rare tree with bark as strong as metal. You know it only grows on the northern slopes of mountains."
input: [SCENE]: Looking for an Ironwood tree.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Despite looking for the wrong tree in the wrong place, you stumble upon a small grove of Ironwood trees by pure chance."
input: [SCENE]: Looking for an Ironwood tree.,output: [OUTCOME]: You spend a whole day searching the southern slopes for a tree that does not exist. Your search is fruitless.
input: [SCENE]: You are trying to get information from someone.,output: [OUTCOME]: You are trying to get information from a member of the city watch. You know he has a weakness for a particular brand of expensive Elven wine.
input: [SCENE]: Trying to bribe a guard with wine.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guard is a hopeless alcoholic. He doesn't care what brand it is, as long as it's alcohol. He accepts your bribe and tells you what you want to know."
input: [SCENE]: Trying to bribe a guard with wine.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The guard is offended by your offer. 'Do I look like a man who drinks dwarven swill?' he says, and refuses to speak with you further."
input: [SCENE]: You are in a room that is slowly filling with water.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The room is made of seamless stone, and water is pouring in from a series of grates in the ceiling. There is a single, heavy iron door."
input: [SCENE]: In a flooding room.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You unleash a massive fireball. The intense heat instantly turns a large amount of the water into steam, temporarily lowering the water level."
input: [SCENE]: In a flooding room.,output: [OUTCOME]: Your fire spell is immediately extinguished by the rising water. You've wasted a spell and are now standing in even deeper water.
input: [SCENE]: You are trying to get past a sleeping guard dog.,"output: [OUTCOME]: A large, mean-looking mastiff is sleeping in front of the door you need to get through. A half-eaten slab of meat is on the floor next to it."
input: [SCENE]: Getting past a sleeping guard dog.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You move with surprising silence for a person of your size. The mastiff snores on, completely unaware as you slip past it."
input: [SCENE]: Getting past a sleeping guard dog.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You are not a subtle person. You knock over a suit of armor with a loud crash, and the mastiff immediately wakes up, barking loudly."
"input: [SCENE]: The party is exploring a silent, ancient library.","output: [OUTCOME]: The only sound in the vast, dusty library is the faint, melodic chiming of a tiny bell coming from the floor above."
"input: [SCENE]: In a silent library, hearing a bell chime upstairs.","output: [OUTCOME]: Your spell works perfectly, silencing your party's steps. You are able to move towards the sound of the bell without making a sound."
"input: [SCENE]: In a silent library, hearing a bell chime upstairs.",output: [OUTCOME]: Your spell fizzles with a loud 'pop' that echoes in the silent library. The gentle chiming of the bell from upstairs immediately stops.
input: [SCENE]: The party is in the office of a corrupt city official.,output: [OUTCOME]: The official sits behind a large oak desk. A heavy iron key hangs from a hook on the wall behind him.
input: [SCENE]: In an official's office with a key on the wall.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You move like a ghost. The heavy iron key is in your hand, and you are back in your seat before the official even looks up."
input: [SCENE]: In an official's office with a key on the wall.,"output: [OUTCOME]: You reach for the iron key, but your sleeve catches on a book. The noise makes the official look up, and he sees you reaching for his key."
input: [SCENE]: The party is confronting a bandit leader in their hideout.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The bandit leader, a large woman with a cruel sneer, stands before you, flanked by her two heavily-armed lieutenants."
input: [SCENE]: Confronting a bandit leader and her two lieutenants.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Despite your miscount, your commanding presence is undeniable. The two lieutenants glance nervously at each other, and the leader's sneer falters."
input: [SCENE]: Confronting a bandit leader and her two lieutenants.,output: [OUTCOME]: The bandit leader laughs. 'You can't even count? There are only two of them!' Your attempt at intimidation is ruined by your mistake.
input: [SCENE]: The party is observing a goblin shaman performing a ritual.,"output: [OUTCOME]: The goblin shaman chants in a guttural language, holding a pulsating, bright green crystal aloft in its hand."
input: [SCENE]: Observing a goblin shaman with a green crystal.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your arrow flies true, shattering the green crystal in a shower of emerald light. The shaman's ritual is broken."
input: [SCENE]: Observing a goblin shaman with a green crystal.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Your arrow misses the green crystal, whistling past the shaman's ear and alerting it to your presence."
input: [SCENE]: The party is facing a large golem.,"output: [OUTCOME]: A massive golem made of solid, rough-hewn granite blocks the hallway. It has no discernible features, just the raw power of earth and magic."
input: [SCENE]: Facing a granite golem.,"output: [OUTCOME]: Though it's made of granite, not iron, you spot a significant fissure near its shoulder joint where a well-placed strike would do maximum damage."
input: [SCENE]: Facing a granite golem.,output: [OUTCOME]: The granite golem is flawlessly constructed; you find no weaknesses in its solid stone form.
