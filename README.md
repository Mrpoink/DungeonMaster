##How to run the application:##

* You can either clone into this branch or the main one, whichever one you'd like
* Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
* Run the SmolLM2Download.py file in the SMolLM2 folder
* Then follow these steps for compatibility and the Front End:
- You will need to make another folder that reflects the main branch
- cd to the front-end file location
- Run "npm run dev"
- Run the pythoncompatibilitylayerback.py file (I should probably change this file name)
- Interact with the webpage
